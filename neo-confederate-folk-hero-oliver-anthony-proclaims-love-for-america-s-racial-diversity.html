This ginger man is Oliver Anthony. A few weeks ago, he and his song “Rich Men North of Richmond” were trending all over social media. The whole thing was bought and paid for by right-wing groups who were astroturfing their new conservative folk hero, someone who would sing the kinds of songs they want, songs about welfare queens and how white men can’t catch a break in this country. Here’s the song:</p><p></p><p>As I said, this song was artificially amplified and boosted by conservative media, and there was a rush to declare Anthony their new guy, despite widespread mockery of his message:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Country music 1955:<br>Shot my boss<br>After cracking his jaw<br>Loaded up a shell<br>Then I waited for the law</p><p>Country music 2023:<br>Another boy has fudge<br>Tell Congress to act</p><p>— Sam Knight (@samknight1) <a href=#>August 14, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boss gets a dollar<br>While I get a dime<br>Please cut his taxes<br>And deregulate mines <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pEb3LnN1g8</a></p><p>— Nude Gingrich (@JarJarFan69) <a href=#>August 14, 2023</a></p><p>Well, it worked – “Rich Men North of Richmond” <a href=#>debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart</a> this week and every QAnon-adjacent is breathless and delirious about it. The fact that Anthony <a href=#>also has a racist conspiracist history</a> is a feature, not a bug, and apparently he was pretty active in the 9/11 conspiracy community. He is the white supremacist folk hero of their dreams, correct? Well, funny story:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Promoted algorithm boosted "based" red beard hillbilly song guy was faking his accent and says diversity is our strength. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z1t39xBXHI</a></p><p>— Devon Stack (@Black_Pilled) <a href=#>August 22, 2023</a></p><p>Please, this is so funny. The guy playacting a racist hillbilly for profit is like “America’s best asset is our racial diversity” and what happens now? I don’t think it actually matters to his “fans.” Some of them will be mad that he’s not as racist as them, but the conservative campaign marches on.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love how they've spent the last couple weeks insisting there's nothing racist about the neo-confederate welfare queen song but the moment the singer expresses support for a racially integrated society he gets cancelled for being woke.</p><p>— Cecil (@Capricoda) <a href=#>August 22, 2023</a></p><p>Photos courtesy of YouTube.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWtiZn50e82epmabn6OzprDEq5itnY%2BbvK23vqGcq6ePpLmqwsSrlpqmpJ28r8W%2Bqamom5yWtq6%2FvqWmr52Pm7yzq8CmnKuhk5bAoL7AnKCapI%2BZtrex0aygrbFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
