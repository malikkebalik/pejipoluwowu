Her infatuation with the series started in 2008, when he saw the movie "Twilight", which was an adaptation of Meyer's novel of the same name. Subsequently, she dove headfirst into the novels and read the entire series several times over the course of just a few days.

Between January and August 2009, James churned out not one, but two whole books. She was further inspired to actually publish her writing after discovering the world of fan fiction, and did so under the pen name "Snowqueens Icedragon". Her next writing project, which she began writing in August 2009, were what would eventually morph into the "Fifty Shades" books.
