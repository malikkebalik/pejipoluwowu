It shows that Woods' yacht is near the top of the celeb yacht hierarchy, at least in terms of size. At 155 feet, it surpasses the 138-foot motor yacht owned by comedian <a href=# title="Jerry Seinfeld Net Worth">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, as well as the relatively modest 74-foot craft <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman Net Worth">Nicole Kidman</a> has to her name.&nbsp;Venus, the motor yacht currently possessed by <a href=# title="Laurene Powell Jobs Net Worth">Laurene Powell Jobs</a> (and which used to belong to <a href=# title="Steve Jobs Net Worth">Steve Jobs</a> before his death) beats it by over a hundred feet though, measuring in at 256 feet. And even that falls well short of Microsoft co-founder <a href=# title="Paul Allen Net Worth">Paul Allen</a>'s&nbsp;Octopus, reportedly a chart-topping 416 feet.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-261227 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-94287778-e1529341068255.jpg alt width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-261227 class=wp-caption-text>Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p><p>Of course, it's extremely possible, or even likely, you've never been close to any yachts of this size to give you an appropriate sense of scale. But you can still get a sense of how large these yachts (including Tiger's&nbsp;Privacy) really are by comparing their lengths to some famous landmarks. For example, the famous Hollywood Sign measures 352 feet across, making it longer than all of the aforementioned yachts except the&nbsp;Octopus. Don't feel too bad for Tiger or the size of his yacht though, since it still safely beats out the 151-foot Statue of Liberty and a 105-foot blue whale.</p><p>In the end, it wasn't the size of&nbsp;Privacy but the comfort and convenience it offered him as a way to escape the "tournament scene" during the US Open, and eliminate concerns about traffic and other transit issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC0xKucrGWYpMRuwMignKtlp6S8pb%2BMa2emZamWsKnAjJympqiRp7K0edOoZKismJq%2Fbq%2FEpZybZamWsKnA0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
