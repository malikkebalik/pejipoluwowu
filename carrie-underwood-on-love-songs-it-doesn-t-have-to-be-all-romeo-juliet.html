Her sparkly, caped gown was Yas Couture by Elie Madi. Pretty, right?</p><p>American Idol alum and voice of the Sunday Night Football theme song on NBC (which always perks my boyfriend up), Carrie Underwood, chatted with E! in advance of last night’s American Music Awards performance (of her new single, “Heartbeat”, which <a href=#>you can see here</a>). The 32 year-old singer, who won the award for Favorite Female Country singer, talked about life possibly not imitating art as far as romance is concerned, life as a Mom and her dream duet. Carrie, married to Nashville Predators player Mike Fisher, can write a hell of a song about revenge (“Before He Cheats”) and a song that makes this non-smoker want to light one up (Smoke Break”), but she claims writing romantic songs like “Heartbeat” is truly a challenge.</p><p>It’s a lot coming from me. I don’t do romance very well, at least not in my music. But I felt like when we were writing it, it was just so genuine and I think that’s one of my problems with love songs. It’s all like fairy tales and bubblegum and butterflies. That’s just not reality. I felt like as we were writing it, it was so conversational and this is my life. This is me and my husband just needing to be alone. It doesn’t have to be all presents and Romeo and Juliet. It can be simple and lovely.</p><p>[From <a href=#>E! News</a>]</p><p>(Note by Kaiser: that line about Romeo & Juliet was Taylor Swift shade, correct?)</p><p>Carrie went on to say that she and Mike are definitely out of the “honeymoon phase” of their marriage, since their 9 month old son Isaiah has become the center of attention, with Carrie describing him as a “squirmy kid.” And, come on, nothing says romance like “poopy diapers”, right?</p><p>As for Carrie’s dream duet, anyone who saw her <a href=#>faithful cover</a> of Guns ‘n’ Roses’ “Paradise City” at 2013’s CMA Music Festival would not be surprised that she’d love to share the stage with Axl Rose, admitting “people like him [who] taught me how to sing. They were so different. I look at people like him and Freddie Mercury, those people who were doing all these crazy runs. It was so different.”</p><p>Of course, since Carrie and Brad Paisley made a few jokes at the expense of Blake Shelton at the recent CMA Awards, when asked what she thought of the pairing of Blake and Gwen Stefani, Carrie (who counts Blake’s ex, Miranda Lambert, as a friend) diplomatically said, “I have not seen them together yet. You just hope everybody’s happy or will be happy.”</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wenn23198759.jpg alt=wenn23198759 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wenn23198227.jpg alt=wenn23198227 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW1oZ355e8KaqauhlZTCr7DEq66op5SUvK%2Bry6itnpejpLuov76iq6yXlKSytLrTmJ%2BarpWUwbCrwZ6WmqSclL%2BwucSolqOtnJ6ytXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
