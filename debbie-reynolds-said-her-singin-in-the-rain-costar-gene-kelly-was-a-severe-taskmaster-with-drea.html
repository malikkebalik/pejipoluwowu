She recalled her determination to prove to her costar and film director Gene Kelly that she could handle the involved dance numbers.</p><p id=par-4_39>Kelly was a professional dancer classically trained in ballet. Their costar Donald O’Connor was a “triple threat,” an actor, singer, and dancer. At 19, Reynolds was a newcomer and unwanted by Kelly, the biggest star at film studio MGM.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-3287752.jpg><p id=par-5_44>“Gene definitely hadn’t wanted me as his costar,” he wrote. “But Louis B. Mayer [cofounder of MGM] himself had chosen me to play Kathy Selden, and there was nothing Gene could do about it, even though he was MGM’s biggest star at the time.”</p><p id=par-6_39>It was one thing knowing Kelly was unhappy with Reynolds as his costar. It was altogether dejecting, as Reynolds wrote, when Kelly “criticized everything I did and never gave me a word of encouragement. He was a severe taskmaster.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Debbie Reynolds was horrified when Gene Kelly kissed her</h2><p id=par-7_24>Reynolds, who died in 2016, described her body’s automatic reaction to an on-screen kiss with Gene Kelly, that left her disgusted and Kelly furious.</p><p id=par-8_43>“In Singin’ In the Rain, Gene and I play two people falling in love. [During] one of the film’s many famous scenes, the camera comes down from an overhead crane as we kiss and “You Are My Lucky Star” swells on the soundtrack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-156476661.jpg><p id=par-9_31>“The camera closed in. Gene took me tightly in his arms…and shoved his tongue down my throat. ‘Eeew! What was that?,’ I screeched, breaking free of his grasp and spitting.</p><p id=par-10_45>“I ran around frantic, yelling for some Coca-Cola to cleanse my mouth. It was the early 1950s, and I was an innocent kid who had never been French-kissed. It felt like an assault. I was stunned that this 39-year-old man would do this to me.</p><p id=par-11_23>His costar’s outburst upset Kelly, but the show had to go on. Reynolds and Kelly re-filmed the scene that fans know and love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds remained friends after making the film</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-520033369-2.jpg><p id=par-12_41>Since the making of the beloved musical that ranked No. 5 in the <a href=#>American Film Institute’s</a> “100 Greatest American Films Of All Time” list, Gene Kelly <a href=#>reportedly</a> said, “I wasn’t very nice to Debbie. I’m surprised she still speaks to me.”</p><p id=par-13_21>Reynolds wrote with affection and gratitude of her relationship with Kelly in the years after they filmed Singin’ In the Rain.</p><p id=par-14_56>“He transformed an untrained high school girl into a dancer,” she wrote. “In the early ’70s, Gene came to see me when I was starring in Irene, my first time ever on Broadway. After the show, he came backstage, hugged me, told me how proud he was of me, and kissed me – no tongue.</p><p id=par-15_6>“I was so moved, I cried.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxpq7BopxmqpWuu7C4w6xkrJmZmXqpsdFmqqKml567brXNZquhnV2nrqq6jJymrKyRp3qosc2eZKSdnKHGbsPArGSaZaOaw6a%2BxGarmquboq60wMSrZLChpJ16pb7EmpufrZxivK950pypnp2eYriqv9KeqmegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
