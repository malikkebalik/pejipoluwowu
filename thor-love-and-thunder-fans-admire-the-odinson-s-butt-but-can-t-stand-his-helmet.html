Plus, Natalie Portmanâ€™s Jane Foster completely steals the spotlight as the Goddess of Thunder and Marvel fans are itching to see the variant pummel some baddies. However, many viewers have noted the poor CGI of Thor and Janeâ€™s helmets, which are so obviously computer-generated. Check out the comments below from Marvel fans who are not happy with the incompetent attempts to replicate headgear.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thor Love And Thunder looks fine but this shot genuine fucking appalled me</p><p>WHY DID YOU NEED TO PUT A CGI HELMET ON HIS HEAD</p><p>JUST MAKE ONE <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aq8sDYlfie</a></p>â€” Sapph AKA The Basement Man (@SapphireTheDude) <a href=#>May 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>whatâ€™s the deal with marvel and cgi suits LMFAO this looks awful. could they not make a physical helmet for either thor <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/osB52KOQXx</a></p>â€” alex inc. ðŸ’› (@honeyghosted) <a href=#>May 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Insane how Marvel are too obsessed CGIâ€™ing everything that theyâ€™d rather have Thor and Jane Foster look like Snapchat filters than to wear an actual helmet lmao <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Uf9ApmE3at</a></p>â€” damo (@MFDAMO) <a href=#>May 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does Mighty Thorâ€™s helmet need to be CGI? No. It looks ridiculous. Make it for gods sake. Itâ€™s not like Marvel Studios doesnâ€™t have the money.</p>â€” luca (@elessarr__) <a href=#>May 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Understandably, Marvel fans are furious, especially after the franchise has experienced plenty of ups and downs lately. Multiverse of Madness received mixed reactions, but Spider-Man: No Way Home hit several home runs as far as critics and audiences alike are concerned. There has been plentiful doubts surrounding the future of the MCU, especially as the Multiverse opens up and more characters join the fold. Plus, many re-casts are garnering negative responses and arguments that Marvel Studios is becoming a corporate cash-grab are circling the internet.</p><p data-characters=680 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Honestly, Marvel fans have every right to be frustrated. As of May 2022, the MCU has earned&nbsp;more than $25 billion worldwide, making it the biggest movie franchise ever. Surely they could afford to have real helmets made and not rely on CGI alternatives? Itâ€™s not like they donâ€™t have the money. Come on, Marvel. You could afford to be a little less stingy. Arguably, helmets are awkward and clunky when actors are performing stunts, but Marvel relies on its surrealism and poor CGI has a negative impact on their ability to immerse an audience. Hopefully, the CGI issue will get fixed before July, but these changes could potentially delay the theatrical release.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>If it remains on schedule, Thor: Love and Thunder will arrive in theatres on July 8, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhpqtlnKTDpnnAp5tmrJiqu6Wx0WadmqajYq6lucirnGasmJp6sLDIp6qopqNir7bA02aZrqxdmK6vwIysq5qmlGK1qr%2BMoZylpZWpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
