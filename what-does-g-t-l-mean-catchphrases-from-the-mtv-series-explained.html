‘G.T.L.’ means ‘Gym, Tan, Laundry’ on ‘Jersey Shore’  The roommates on Jersey Shore have lived by the ritual that is “gym, tan, laundry” from the get-go.

Regularly, the roommates would pack up their laundry and take it to the laundromat, but not before hitting the gym first.</p><p id=par-3_49>After getting a good pump at the gym and procuring clean clothes, the final step was perfecting their tans. Because who has time to sit on the beach all day? The roommates kept the tanning salons in Seaside Heights, New Jersey busy thanks to the&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;“G.T.L.” way of life.</p><h2 id=h-the-shirt-before-the-shirt-comes-before-t-shirt-time>‘The Shirt Before the Shirt’ comes before ‘T-shirt Time’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_31>On&nbsp;Jersey Shore, it’s essentially a crime to go out if you’re looking anything less than fresh to death. Part of the “T-shirt Time” ritual requires “The Shirt Before the Shirt.”</p><p id=par-5_36>As the wise DJ Pauly D has pointed out countless times, you can’t put your “going out” shirt on until it’s time to leave. “The Shirt Before the Shirt” is a pre-gaming requirement for the&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;roommates.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_40>Of course, after “The Shirt Before the Shirt” comes the paramount “T-shirt Time.” Once the cabs arrived — <a href=#>usually around 10:30 PM</a> — it was time for the men to don their “going out shirts” while singing, “It’s T-shrit tiiime!”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-smush-room-is-for-smushing>The ‘Smush Room’ is for ‘smushing’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_23>The&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;roommates didn’t use the term “<a href=#>hook up</a>” to describe when they would have sex with someone. The word for that is “smushing.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_50>During the early days of Jersey Shore, every location the roommates stayed featured a “Smush Room.” Translation: a private room for the roommates to bring their guests and have sex with them if they choose. And yes, the “Smush Room” always had a camera in it. For posterity, of course.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-dj-pauly-d-introduces-the-i-f-f-on-jersey-shore>DJ Pauly D introduces the ‘I.F.F.’ on ‘Jersey Shore’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_23>In season 2 of&nbsp;Jersey Shore, DelVecchio founded the “I’m F*cked Foundation” in <a href=#>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</a>‘s name. “Ronnie is President of the I.F.F.,” DelVecchio said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_45>When Ortiz-Magro and Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola were an item, cameras captured evidence of “Rahn” climbing to the top of the “I.F.F.” Since the trend of Ortiz-Magro being unfaithful and lying about his indiscretions continued in&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, the foundation lives on in his name.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-jersey-shore-changed-the-definition-of-robbery>‘Jersey Shore’ changed the definition of ‘robbery’</h2><p id=par-11_24>When the&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;roommates say “pull a robbery,” they’re not talking about robbing a bank. They’re talking about taking another roommate’s guy or girl away.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_33>During the early days of&nbsp;Jersey Shore, <a href=#>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</a> took pride in his ability to “pull a robbery.” He wasn’t alone, as Vinny Guadagnino pulled the move a few times, too.</p><p id=par-13_32>The act of “pulling a robbery” isn’t as common now since most of the roommates have settled down, gotten married, and started having kids. But the memory lives on in fan’s hearts.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z5xq2jZqWVlrtur8CtmqGomKeutLHSZqStrl2osrO1xKxknrCgoa6qusSdZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
