When the first ever golden bachelor disrobed to jump into a hot tub, his ink became a serious talking point. Some of <a href=#>The Golden Bachelor </a>fans theorized that the retired restauranteur has a lion tattoo because his <a href=#>astrological sign</a> is Leo. While that would make sense, there is apparently far more to it than that. In a recent interview, Turner cleared things up. His tattoo has a deeper meaning and isn’t tied to astrology.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gerry Turner explains his lion tattoo&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_56>Gerry Turner’s lion tattoo has been the talk of Bachelor Nation in recent weeks. Now, the retiree is opening up about the tattoo’s meaning. During his appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Live With Kelly and Mark</a>, host Kelly Ripa questioned Turner about his tattoo. Turner was more than happy to share it’s meaning and why he still wears it proudly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_75>Turner revealed that he got the ink when he was planning a big career move. Apprehensive about the decision, he was reminded that movement is necessary for survival. He explained that the tattoo is a reminder that you always have to be running. He said that he had the large tattoo done as a reminder that “It doesn’t matter if you’re a lion or a gazelle, when the sun comes up, you better be running.”</p><p id=par-4_58>The actual depiction appears to have come from a poster that Turner saw somewhere along the way.<a href=#> The first-ever Golden Bachelor </a>did not mention when exactly he got the tattoo or if he is hiding additional ink anywhere else on his body.&nbsp;The first tattoo shocked viewers of the series; we imagine additional tattoos would be equally surprising.</p><h2 id=h-the-meaning-is-more-unique-than-most-viewers-assumed>The meaning is more unique than most viewers assumed&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_74>While Turner’s tattoo has a pretty deep and personal meaning, it is easy to see why some fans assumed it was a reference to his astrological sign. Lion tattoos are associated with people born under Leo. The septuagenarian was born on Aug. 7, meaning he is a Leo. The astrological sign’s association with the lion makes it a commonly tattooed astrological sign, although it’s the second-rarest sign in the United States, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amp Agency</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gerry-Turner-Golden-Bachelor-Dating-Obstacle.jpg><p id=par-6_47>While Leos, proud of their star sign, commonly use the animal in their tattoos, the lion tattoo has many meanings. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron and Ink</a>, lion tattoos are typically used to signify strength, bravery, and fearlessness. It sounds like that was Gerry Turner’s intention with his tattoo, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_30>Turner will pick the winner of The Golden Bachelor on Nov. 30. The retiree will need all the strength and bravery he can get to choose<a href=#> between the finalists.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoKalnJWjeqOtwqGcpaeiYsC1rdFmnp6qoq56tcHRp5yrZaKaw6aty6xkraCVYrqmrc2ipaBlkpq1qrrDZp%2Biq12htrC6jK2YrayfpHqiusNmoK1lmJbAbrrOrZ%2BippdiwbB5w6hksKGknXqptdJmsaicmZawbr%2FIoKVnoKSiuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
