Rarely do they venture into the supernatural — why would they, when real life can be so terrifying? However, this week's movie is a notable exception, incorporating the other worldly element that made movies like <i>The Conjuring </i>and <i>The Amityville Horror </i>so terrifying. <i>House Of Darkness</i> is Lifetime's answer to all of those films that made you scared to turn the lights off at night, and it might be the network's creepiest offering yet. The kicker? According to Lifetime's website, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>House Of Darkness</i> is based on a true story</a>, so prepare to be even more creeped out.</p><p>Here's the network's synopsis of the undoubtedly scary film:</p>Inspired by true events, the supernatural thriller House of Darkness recounts the mysterious case of a San Francisco family who claimed that a dark force was responsible for the tragic events that unfolded... Trying to save their struggling marriage Kelly, her husband Brian and their daughter Sarah, move to a rural farmhouse in search of some serenity. Unbeknownst to them, nearly every family that has lived in the house has suffered some form of tragedy, dating back nearly 100 years... Will Kelly and her family be the next victims of the dark forces in the house?<p>It's unclear exactly what "true events" the movie is inspired by and though it does have a similar title to<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> the book <i>House of</i> </a><i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>House Of Darkness, House Of Light: The True Story</a>, </i>that's likely not the source material. Nowhere on Lifetime's website does it say the film is the connected to the book, and most importantly, <i>House Of Darkness, House Of Light</i> was written by Andrea Perron, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>whose experiences with the paranormal inspired </a><i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The Conjuring</a>. </i>Since the book was already adapted as a movie, Lifetime's <i>House of Darkness </i>likely is based on a different story, especially since Perron's experience went down in Rhode Island, while the TV movie is set in San Francisco.</p><p>But hey, maybe we're better off not knowing the exact true origins of Lifetime's <i>House of Darkness </i>or what really happened in the end <i>— </i>that just makes watching it all the more terrifying.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZJsZ21lmah6qbvUrJxmp5ZisaK%2ByqecrKtdlnq1vtSeZKysn6fGbsDHnmSloZaawaq5xGakqK6Zmnq4tculZKybkaeybsXOrmSnp12irrXAxKtksKCRqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
