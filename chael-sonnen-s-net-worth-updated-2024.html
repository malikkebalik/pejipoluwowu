He is the two-time and current UFC Heavyweight Champion.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stipe Miocic was born on the 19th of August, 1982, in Ohio.</p><p>Even though the family lived in difficult, there was no dearth of necessities when Stipe was growing up and both his parents worked to provide their kids with a better lifestyle.</p><p>When he was 3 years old, his parents divorced and his father went back to Croatia.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since childhood, Stipe Miocic has been involved with sports, wrestling, and playing baseball and football while at Eastlake North High School.&nbsp;</p><p>While at university, he received interest from Major League Baseball teams and played Division II baseball at Coker College as a junior.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he could have joined any of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-mlb-teams/ data-lasso-id=143452 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest MLB teams</u></a>, Miocic had other skills he chose to explore and hone.&nbsp;</p><p>He also wrestled in the 197 lbs weight class for the Cleveland State Vikings, and he competed in the 2003 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Miocic’s Early Career</h3><p>While he was still in school, Stipe Miocic was made a training partner of Dan Bobish at Strong Style MMA Training Centre in Ohio.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing school, he returned to the training center once more, and while he started with mixed martial arts, he soon changed his focus to boxing.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite only training for several months, his coach, Marcus Marinelli, stated he could beat boxers with years more experience.&nbsp;</p><p>With eight months of training under his belt, he had already become a Golden Gloves boxing champion, reaching the quarter-finals in the nationals.&nbsp;</p><p>However, inspired by the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/top-20-richest-mma-fighters-world/ data-lasso-id=143453 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest MMA fighters in the world</u></a>, Miocic eventually turned back to mixed martial arts, which kicked off his career.&nbsp;</p><h3>A Talented Fighter</h3><p>Once he had officially started his MMA career, Stipe Miocic won his first six fights by knocking out his opponents.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, he signed a multi-fight deal with the UFC and made his debut against Joey Beltran, winning with a unanimous decision.&nbsp;</p><p>He faced Phil De Fries in February 2012, winning the fight in the first round via KO, and earned the Knockout of the Night award.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months later, he faced newcomer Shane del Rosario and won with a TKO in the second round.&nbsp;</p><p>He lost his first fight in September 2012 to Stefan Struve via TKO, though both fighters won Fight of the Night honors.</p><p>The following year, he was scheduled to face Soa Palelei but ended up squaring off with Roy Nelson after Palelei was injured.&nbsp;</p><p>After winning that fight, he took on Gabriel Gonzaga, winning by a unanimous decision with <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/junior-dos-santos-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143454 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Junior dos Santos</u></a> as his next opponent.&nbsp;</p><h3>Beating The Odds</h3><p>While an injury sidelined Junior, Miocic fought Fábio Maldonado instead, winning via TKO and earning Fight of the Night honors.&nbsp;</p><p>In December, he finally got to take on dos Santos, but lost the fight by unanimous decision, his second significant loss.&nbsp;</p><p>He was expected to face Ben Rothwell at UFC Fight Night 76 in 2015, but Rothwell ended up pulling out.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Miocic faced <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/andrei-arlovski-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143455 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Andrei Arlovski</u></a> who he defeated in the first round for a Performance of the Night bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, he was poised to fight Fabrício Werdum at the UFC Heavyweight Championship until Werdum pulled out with a back injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the pair squared off in 2016, and Miocic dished out Werdum’s first loss since 2011 to win the championship.&nbsp;</p><h3>A Reigning Champion</h3><p>Miocic defeated his title for the first time in 2016 against <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/alistair-overeem-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143456 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Alistair Overeem</u></a>, and while he got knocked down, he came back to win via KO.&nbsp;</p><p>At UFC 211, Stipe Miocic defended his championship title again, this time from Junior dos Santos, who he’d previously lost to by unanimous decision.</p><p>However, this time, Miocic dominated dos Santos to maintain his titles, taking down his opponent midway through the first round.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, he faced <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/francis-ngannou-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143457 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Francis Ngannou</u></a> at UFC 220 in one of the most exciting fights in UFC history and he walked away victorious.&nbsp;</p><p>For his fourth title defense, he faced <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/daniel-cormier-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143458 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Daniel Cormier</u></a>, the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in what was dubbed a “super fight.”&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, he <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://bloodyelbow.com/2018/07/08/ufc-226-results-stipe-miocic-vs-daniel-cormier-mma-news/ data-lasso-id=143459 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>lost via a knockout</u></a> in the first round, though it was controversial since Cormier had jabbed Miocic in the eye.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rematches And Comebacks</h3><p>In August 2019, Stipe Miocic and Cormier had a rematch for the Heavyweight Championship title, and this tie Miocic won.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he ended up being out of the game until 2020 due to retinal damage from another accidental eye poke from Cormier.&nbsp;</p><p>Once back, a trilogy fight between Miocic and Cormier was set for August, which Miocic won, though both fighters suffered eye pokes during the match.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, he faced Francis Ngannou again at UFC 260 but lost during the second round via knockout.&nbsp;</p><p>After a two-year hiatus, he was scheduled to face Jon Jones in November 2023, but the fight was scrapped after Jones suffered a pectoral injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite not being as well-known as <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/conor-mcgregor-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143460 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Conor McGregor</u></a>, Stipe Miocic’s MMA record is

of the best heavyweight fighters of all time, and he has proven it by being a champion. That is something that I want to be in my career, and I understand to achieve that, I have to beat guys like him.”&nbsp;<strong>– Stipe Miocic</strong></p><p>“People have always worn Cleveland shirts and supported Cleveland no matter how bad the teams were or how close we were. It didn’t matter. That’s really all about the city. We’re just hardworking people that love the city and don’t care how the teams do.” <strong>– Stipe Miocic</strong></p><p>“My day job keeps me grounded. When I show up to work, I’m not some star fighter or anything, I’m just Stipe. I’m going to keep working in my hometown as long as I can.”&nbsp;<strong>– Stipe Miocic&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“There is still so much room for me to get better. Everyone in this sport evolves so quickly. You could take six months off and come back to a totally different game. That’s why I’m always in the gym working. Even if I don’t have a fight lined up, I’m still in there working to improve my overall game.”&nbsp;<strong>– Stipe Miocic&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I do miss the Avalanche. That’s the my favorite car of all time, but that Dodge Ram Rebel has overtaken the Avalanche; I just love that truck. It’s got good vents in the hood; there’s no running boards underneath, so I can go Baja-ing if I want to, off-roading.”&nbsp;<strong>– Stipe Miocic</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-life-lessons-from-stipe-miocic></span>3 Life Lessons from Stipe Miocic&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now that you know all about Stipe Miocic’s net worth, and how he achieved success; let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from him:&nbsp;</p><h3>1.
