However, the unfortunate fact is that it is even harder if you're black. Of the 607 billionaires in the United States, only five are African American. This is just another example of the widening gap between the economic opportunities given to black and white Americans. Since 1992, the median wealth of black families has not grown by any real measurable amount, while the median net worth of white families has increased by more than $50,000. This isn't just a problem in the United States, either. Only 13 of the 2,153 billionaires across the globe are black.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>#5. <a href=#>Jay-Z</a></strong></p><p><strong>Net worth</strong>: $1 billion</p><p><strong>Source of wealth</strong>: music, investments</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth first started tracking Jay-Z's net worth in September 2009. At that point, he was worth $300 million. Over the past decade, he's done a lot. He got married. Had kids. Released music and went on tour. Made some investments. He's come a long way since he dropped out of high school to be a drug dealer.</p><p>Jay-Z makes money from touring and albums of course, but he's also a verified business mogul with a portfolio of business that includes liquor, real estate, art, and stakes in companies, including Uber. He is hip hop's first billionaire and most of his money comes from ownership of Armand de Brignac champagne, his cognac partnership with Bacardi, investments, and his stake in the music streaming business Tidal</p><p><strong>#4. <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Net worth</strong>:&nbsp;$1.9 billion</a></p><p><strong>Source of wealth</strong>: sports, endorsements</p><p>Michael Jordan is the highest-paid athlete of all time, but not because of his salary from the Chicago Bulls. Jordan didn't make as much playing basketball during his 15 seasons with the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards as he made off the court with endorsements. Over his NBA career, Jordan earned $93 million. Today he brings home more than $100 million a year from his endorsement deal with Nike alone. We'd all like to be like Mike and have a net worth of $1.9 billion. When it comes to the question of how Michael Jordan&nbsp;earned his net worth, the simple answer is Nike and the Hornets.</p><p>Today the Nike-owned Jordan brand accounts for about 50% of the basketball sneaker market&nbsp;and makes an average of $3 billion in revenue for Nike annually (give or take). In any given year, Michael earns $80 – $100 million off Nike royalties.</p><p>The Charlotte Hornets NBA team is far and away Jordan's biggest asset. He was a minority investor in the team starting in 2006 and took control of the team in 2010. Jordan's timing in buying majority control of the Hornets could not have been better. When he was approved for the deal in March 2010, the franchise was valued at $175 million. Since that time, NBA values have skyrocketed. He owns about 90% of the franchise, which was most recently valued at a minimum of $1.1 billion, including $150 million in debt. Jordan's stake in the Hornets is worth roughly $1 billion alone.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294129 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-924711442.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294129 class=wp-caption-text>Christopher Polk/Getty Images</p><p><strong>#3. <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong></p><p><strong>Net worth</strong>: $3.5 billion</p><p><strong>Source of wealth</strong>: media</p><p>Oprah Winfrey is the Queen of all Media. She is a talk show host, actress, producer, pitchwoman, and philanthropist. Pretty much everything she touches turns to gold. That's not to say that she doesn't work hard for her success – no one works harder than Oprah. She is best known for her award-winning, beloved, nationally syndicated talk show, which ran from 1986 to 2011. She is one of the wealthiest African Americans of the 20th&nbsp;and 21st&nbsp;centuries. She is definitely the most generous black philanthropist in U.S. history. At one time, she was the world's only African American billionaire. She's got a cable network, her acting career, her magazine, the shows she produces, and let's not forget her lucrative endorsement deal with Weight Watchers, to name just a few of her income streams. Oprah makes anywhere from $75 million to $300 million each year, which has given her an amazing net worth of $3.5 billion. What is even more amazing and inspirational about Oprah is that she is 100% self-made.</p><p><strong>#2.
