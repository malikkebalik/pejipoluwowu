Getting back yet again to the titular plane of Dominaria, which has acted as the setting for a few biggest plots in MTG lore.</span></p><p><span>However, Dominaria United is not only an expansion set, but this upcoming set will also mark the 30th anniversary of the trading card game. Dominaria was the first plane visited in MTG and has some of the most famous characters including Nicol Bolas, Liliana Vess, and Urza.</span></p><p><span>It’s the <a href=# rel=noopener>Magic Multiverse’s center</a>, and seems like a new one among these is set to launch, since Dominaria United will be the first set in a four-set story-arc “where the fate of Dominaria—and the Multiverse—is set to unravel”.</span></p><p><span>Before the launch of the game, here we are with everything you should know about Dominaria United.</span></p><h2>Dominaria United Release Date</h2><p><span>The launch date of Dominaria United was revealed in May during a Livestream; it is set to kick off on September 9 across the globe. There will be a few weeks’ worths of spoilers and card previews to attract before then, including pre-release events the week ahead of its release, from September 2 to 8.</span></p><h2>Dominaria United Spoilers</h2><p><span>The Dominaria United spoiler season has not come out, hence, currently, there are no card previews. We will update this section as they show up from the depths of Wizards HQ.</span></p><p><span>Though we are obviously aware of a few things that set will bring for us. It will be the beginning of a new story arc that will span four sets and have major stakes for the entire <a href=# rel=noopener>MTG multiverse</a>. Provided that Magic’s next big bad looks to be the evil robot Phyrexians certainly; they have been coming in sets for a couple of years now, and it definitely doesn’t seem difficult to predict what this might be.</span></p><p><span>The set symbol for Dominaria United appears to be the logo of ‘The Coalition’, a unified forces group made by Urza that avoided a Phyrexian invasion of the plane.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dominaria-United-Release-Date.jpg><p><span>Apart from these, set packaging has also been revealed that gives us a hint of the characters we can expect to come to Dominaria United. We have got metal planeswalker Karn for starters, visible on the draft booster box with Jodah, Archmage Eternal, and Shanna, Sisay’s Legacy.</span></p><p><span>Magic’s well-known flying ship, the Weatherlight, also shows up in the background of the picture, hence, a new card displaying this airboat appears to be possible.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, we also got planeswalkers Ajani and Liliana on the set boosters and a cartoon portrayal of Braids on the Collector Boosters. Teferi also appears in Dominaria United’s artwork.</span></p><h2>Dominaria United Mechanics</h2><p><span>As of now, there is no announcement regarding specific mechanics, attributes, or peculiarities of the set. Considering that we have had no spoilers currently, that should not come as a surprise possibly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, that’s all we know about the upcoming Dominaria United. We will keep you updated with all the latest information until then<a href=# rel=noopener> stay tuned</a> to our website.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dga3xyhI6dpqahnpa%2Fqq2MrqWirJWZerOxy56YrJ1dma61sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
