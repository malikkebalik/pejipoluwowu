Kieran Culkin's net worth is still impressive although he earned most of it from his role as Roman Roy in HBO's 'Succession.' How much does he make per episode?
Published on December 11, 2021   2 min read Kieran Culkin began his acting career as a child actor in the 1990s but didn’t begin acquiring the majority of his net worth until starring in HBO’s Succession. He began developing a name for himself after starring in his breakthrough role in Igby Goes Down in 2002."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He began developing a name for himself after starring in his breakthrough role in&nbsp;Igby Goes Down&nbsp;in 2002. However, Culkin is most well known for his role as&nbsp;<a href=#>Roman Roy</a>, the inappropriate youngest son of Logan Roy (Brian Cox). What does Kieran Culkin make per&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;episode, and what is his net worth in 2021?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kieran-Culkin-Succession.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kieran-culkin-was-kevin-s-cousin-fuller-mccallister-in-home-alone><strong>Kieran Culkin was Kevin’s cousin, Fuller McCallister, in ‘Home Alone’</strong></h2><p id=par-2_86>Almost 30 years before joining&nbsp;<a href=#>the&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;cast</a>&nbsp;and amassing his considerable net worth, Kieran Culkin took a role in&nbsp;Home Alone&nbsp;with his brother,&nbsp;<a href=#>Macaulay Culkin</a>. Kevin’s brother, Fuller McCallister, was Kieran’s first acting role at the age of 8. Fans will remember Fuller from the classic 1990 Christmas movie as the child who “wets the bed.” Kieran portrayed the child that Kevin did not want to share a bed with the night before the family’s trip to Paris. He reprised his role in 1992 in&nbsp;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_64>Kieran and Macaulay aren’t the only actors in their family. Their younger brother, Rory Culkin, is known for his roles in&nbsp;Scream 4,&nbsp;Lords of Chaos,&nbsp;You Can Count on Me,&nbsp;Columbus, and M. Night Shyamalan’s&nbsp;Signs. Kieran’s father and Broadway stage actor Kit Culkin insisted on raising his children as performers. In addition to Macaulay and Rory, Kieran has four other siblings — Shane, Dakota, Quinn, and Christian.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Macaulay-Culkin-and-Kieran-Culkin-Home-Alone-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kieran Culkin’s net worth and how much he earns per episode of ‘Succession’</strong></h2><p id=par-4_52>When executive producer Jesse Armstrong began production of&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;Season 1, each of the main cast members, including Kieran Culkin, earned $100,000 per episode. For&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;Season 2, the actors earned the same salary per episode. Since each of the first two seasons had 10 episodes, Kieran made $2 million for acting in the HBO series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_46>The main&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;cast members received a&nbsp;<a href=#>salary bump for season 3</a>&nbsp;in the $300,000 range. Culkin’s salary jumped to $350,000 per episode for a total of $3.5 million for the season. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kieran Culkin’s net worth is around $5 million, the majority from his work in&nbsp;Succession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Succession-Season-3-Episode-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How tall is Kieran Culkin?</strong></h2><p id=par-6_92>While watching&nbsp;Succession, many viewers wonder why Culkin’s co-stars look taller than him. Kieran Culkin is 5-foot-6, while&nbsp;<a href=#>Nicholas Braun is a staggering 6-foot-7</a>. Cousin Greg is one of the tallest actors in Hollywood. So, it is no surprise that he looks so tall standing next to Culkin. Although Roman looks short next to cousin Greg in Succession, Culkin is about the same height as many other actors in the series. Brian Cox is the same height as Culkin. Jeremy Strong, who portrays Kendall Roy, is only a few inches taller at 5-foot-8.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_19>Kieran Culkin’s role in&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;opened many doors for him, and viewers can’t wait to see what he works on next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtq%2FCnqqsoZ%2Bjeqy1xKuYp2WTqrmstc1mpZ6sXay8s8DHZpyaqp5ivaa%2BjJ6noqufmbJutMGoZKydop6ytHrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
