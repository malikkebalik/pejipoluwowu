Paulina assumed the tip came from EJ DiMera (Dan Feuerriegel) and seemed skeptical when Chad insisted he hadn’t spoken with his brother in a while.
Regardless, Paulina defended her actions and stood her ground against Chad’s questions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After Chanel felt queasy next, she ran inside to throw up.</p><p>Once Chanel returned, Johnny pointed out that Chanel was experiencing some of the radiation poisoning warning signs that Kayla Johnson (Mary Beth Evans) told them to look out for.</p><p>Although Chanel wasn’t thrilled about the idea of going to the hospital, Johnny and Paulina insisted on taking her there right away.</p><p>At the pub on Tuesday’s DOOL show, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) joined Everett Lynch aka Robert “Bobby” Stein (Blake Berris) to ask if he’d changed his mind about therapy.</p><p>Everett confirmed he hadn’t, so Marlena was baffled since Everett said he was quitting therapy and then lied to Stephanie by acting like he’d continue it.</p><p>Everett suggested he just didn’t want to make Marlena look like a “quack” in front of Stephanie with all that hypnosis stuff. Marlena suggested Everett could perhaps try a new therapist, but he wasn’t interested.</p><p>Next on Tuesday’s Days episode, Stephanie stopped by The Spectator with some gifts for Chad’s kids, so that gave her a chance to speak with Everett.</p><p>Although Everett was in a bad mood over the frustrating article he was writing, Stephanie was glad it didn’t have anything to do with signing the divorce papers.</p><p>Everett assured Stephanie that he wanted nothing to do with Jada Hunter (Elia Cantu) or even Bobby for that matter.</p><p>All Everett wanted to do was put Bobby behind him and live in the present, but Stephanie didn’t understand since she thought Everett was making progress in therapy.</p><p>Nevertheless, Everett was adamant about just moving forward and making new memories – hopefully with Stephanie.</p><p>At one point, Chad returned and accepted the gifts for the kids, who were eager to see Stephanie soon.</p><p>Stephanie was open to the idea when Chad suggested she could come play games with Thomas DiMera (Cary Christopher) and Charlotte DiMera (Autumn Gendron) this weekend.</p><p>At the Kiriakis mansion on Tuesday’s Days episode, <a href=# rel=noopener>Maggie Kiriakis (Suzanne Rogers) told Julie Williams</a> (Susan Seaforth Hayes) about her wedding to Konstantin Meleounis (John Kapelos), so Julie hoped Maggie was protecting herself financially.</p><p>Maggie explained about the prenup, so Julie thought that was good news and ultimately expressed support since Maggie was determined to help Konstantin.</p><p>Chad also met up with Julie and got her side of the Smith Island story, so Julie seemed irritated over Paulina putting everyone at risk.</p><p>In John Black’s (Drake Hogestyn) office, Konstantin gave “The Pawn” updates on the prenuptial agreement and wanted him to break in the Kiriakis safe to steal it.</p><p>Before Konstantin could finish giving “The Pawn” orders, Marlena knocked on the door and called out to John. Konstantin showed John the card again and brought him out of his programming trance.</p><p>Once a confused John opened the door to Marlena, Konstantin said he was there to invite them both to his wedding to Maggie.</p><p>After Konstantin left, John admitted he couldn’t really remember the details of his conversation with Konstantin – and this wasn’t the first time that had happened.</p><p>Marlena suggested maybe John’s brain was protecting him from memories related to Konstantin, but he hinted about other possibilities and seemed worried.</p><p>Although John didn’t know what was going on, he felt disoriented and agreed when Marlena said they should get him home.</p><p>Back with Konstantin, he told himself that it wasn’t meant to be today. However, Konstantin offered a prediction about getting what he wanted next time.</p><p>Days of Our Lives spoilers say Konstantin will continue stirring up trouble, so but he’ll eventually pay the price for his actions!</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for the hottest <a href=# rel=noopener>Days of Our Lives spoilers, predictions, updates and news, so make us your go-to DOOL source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nlJbGtHnOn2SoraJiuarCxKxkq52Tlr1uwNSeqp2ZqWKusb7IpWRsaF2aw6a%2BxK2rZqGeqMKtwNJmqK6Zk6B6rq3RpZynmV2fvKm6jKqsnquknryvv4ymnKanoq56qK3PrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
