Yet it's an unsung name who's going to walk away with more money than anyone else.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Houston Texans fired head coach David Culley after one season. Culley's salary for this year was $5 million. However, his entire contract is guaranteed. As</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400> NFL Network's Tom Pelissero notes</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, that means Culley will get another $17 million over the next three years. Offensive coordinator Tim Kelly was also fired.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327973 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1361112880.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327973 class=wp-caption-text>Bob Levey/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Texans were among the worst teams in the NFL, with a 4-13 record. But Culley was put into a tough situation. At 65 years old, he joined the Texans as the oldest first-time head coach and immediately walked into a firestorm.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Franchise quarterback DeShaun Watson was facing sexual assault allegations and was inactive for every game, despite being healthy. </span><span style=font-weight:400>The team was also without defensive end J.J. Watt and wide receiver Will Fuller, who departed after the 2020 season to Arizona and Miami, respectively. Losing key pieces like that didn't give Culley much of a chance to improve on a 4-12 record from the prior year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Culley released a statement about his time in Houston:</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"I loved every minute of being the head coach of the Houston Texans. I appreciate the players and coaches for staying the course with me through the ups and downs of our season. I'm disappointed we didn't win more games and I won't have a chance to improve on the lessons I've learned, but I fully understand this is a bottom-line business and I didn't do enough. I want to thank the McNair Family and Nick Caserio for giving me this opportunity, I am forever grateful for the experience. I wish this team and organization the best, they are building a special program and I truly believe the future is bright for Texans fans."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In his own statement, Texans general manager Nick Caserio addressed the oddity of firing a coach after one season. However, he said there were "philosophical differences over the long-term direction and vision for our program moving forward."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To add further insult to injury, the Texans sent two third-round picks to the Baltimore Ravens to hire Culley away from the Ravens staff. Baltimore will use the second of those picks in this year's draft. Now, on top of owing $17 million in additional money, the Texans are without a head coach, a draft pick, and have a mess of a situation internally.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Alas, this isn't the first time a team has paid someone to go away. </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Florida State gave Willie Taggart</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> plenty of money to leave, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Charlie Weis has earned additional money</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> at multiple stops, and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby Bonilla has the sweetest deal in all of sports</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue56pdGxqZ26Ecw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
