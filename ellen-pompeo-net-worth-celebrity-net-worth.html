Pompeo was cast as the lead role and title character Meredith Grey, a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. The timing could not have been better. Ellen would later admit that she was "perilously close" to being broke when she read the pilot script. The show was an immediate hit and well received by critics. Her performance has nabbed her five People's Choice Award nominations and three wins. In 2007, Pompeo was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama series, and "Grey's Anatomy" won Best Drama Series that same year. Later that year, Pompeo was honored at a black-tie gala by the National Italian American Foundation for her achievement in entertainment.

For seasons 13 and 14 she earned $350,000 per episode, roughly $8.7 million per year. At this point she did not own any backend equity points on the show. After the 14th season wrapped, Ellen began negotiations for a new contract. Ellen actually approached Grey's creator Shonda Rhimes for negotiating advice. Shonda told her:</p><p>"Decide what you think you're worth and then ask for what you think you're worth. Nobody's just going to give it to you."</p><p>When negotiations were over Ellen walked away with a per episode pay bump to $575,000. That brought her single-season salary up to $14.4 million. But that's not all! She also was given two backend percentage points on the show's syndication profits. Every year that brings Ellen an additional $6-7 million. In total, starting at season 15, Ellen would earn a bit more than $20 million for "Grey's Anatomy." But that's still not all! Ellen's new deal also gives her a producer credit on future Grey's spinoffs and pilot commitments for her production company. For season 19, the star has scaled back her role on the television series for the first time. Pompeo intends to stay on as an executive producer and continue her signature voiceovers for the show.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Pompeo married music producer <a href=#><strong>Chris Ivery</strong></a> on November 9, 2007 with New York City mayor <a href=# title="Michael Bloomberg Net Worth">Michael Bloomberg</a> serving as the legal witness to the ceremony.
