They are a part of a growing comedy-house scene that includes houses like <a href=# data-analytics-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=40 data-uri=6752ccf8278f69189765a105ca590bf9 data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>The Pound</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The Honey House</a>. Rather than learn dances or record trends in front of a ring light, the group plans to write skits and produce content together once they all move into the mansion later this month.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Meish Bailey. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Meish Bailey/Whalar.</span></span></figure><p class=premium>"It's kind of exciting coming together because we are going to make sketches, a miniseries, and see how we can grow our audience," Bailey told Insider.</p><p class=premium>Aside from comedy, group members like Trishann, Qasim, and Thiru are also known for their viral makeup tutorials and for sharing fashion content.</p><p class=premium>LA has become a center for creator houses, and new influencer mansions have continued to pop up despite the pandemic.

By tapping into the two companies' existing brand relationships, the group has advocates to help negotiate brand deals in an industry that has historically&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>underpaid and often ignored</a> Black creators.</p><p class=premium>"From day one of launch, there's an idea not only from a content perspective but also from a brand perspective of how we can integrate them and really provide ample opportunities for these creators," Thirteenth founder Ogo Akamelu (who is known professionally by his first name) said.</p><p class=premium>Akamelu previously handled housewide partnerships for <a href=# data-analytics-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=100 data-uri=50082200cb854511d3e795f65c76465e data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The House That Nobody Asked For</a> (which came to an end in December)&nbsp;and <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>secured brand deals with the likes of Chipotle and Tinder while that house was running</a>.</p><p class=premium>"What's been so encouraging is to see how many giant brands are actually interested in not only engaging with these creators and their audiences but paying them fairly and equitably," Karyn Spencer, Whalar's chief marketing officer, said.</p><p class=premium>The team recently secured a brand sponsor for the house, which they said will be announced soon. They're also offering advertisers the option to sponsor additional content and place products like clothing, makeup and lifestyle enhancements that could serve as backdrops within the house, Whalar said.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Dare Ajibare. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Dare Ajibare/Whalar.</span></span></figure><p class=premium>"The intention is to treat the creators very equitably in the house, so the house deals will be split equally amongst them," Spencer said. "There will likely be individual deals made because of their particular relevance to an individual creator."</p><p class=premium>Securing sponsorships for a content house is a common practice.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Members of the TikTok group <a href=# data-analytics-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=80 data-uri=96baf46052eabb8258167a3717384d45 data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Sway House</a> moved into a mansion provided by the short-form-video app <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Triller</a>. Residents of Collab Crib <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>teamed up</a> with Cash App and Dubsmash for the launch of their house.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=premium>Relying on comedy and the content-planning process</h2><p class=premium>In preparation for the launch, the group has been meeting virtually about once a week to discuss the type of content they want to make, as well as ideas for the house introduction. They created a Google Doc where they'll go back and forth on ideas and plans.</p><p class=premium>The group said they generally don't use ring lights. Instead, Bailey told Insider he had invested in equipment like soft-box lights, studio lights, and shotgun microphones to help filter out any background noise.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Everett Noble. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Everett Noble/Whalar.</span></span></figure><p class=premium>"I film for hours," Trishann said. "A lot of effort and time does go into a short video, and there's a lot going on in the background."&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>The process behind filming a skit includes planning an appropriate time in the day to film to avoid background noise, foot traffic, and real traffic, the group told Insider. Some clips can take up to four hours to film and an additional hour or more to edit.</p><p class=premium>Aside from TikTok, the creators also post content on Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>The Crib Around The Corner</span></span></figure><h2 class=premium>Launching a content house during a pandemic requires careful planning</h2><p class=premium>Starting a collab house during a pandemic is tricky. Some other groups that have tried to launch houses in the past year have had to put their plans <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>on pause</a>.</p><p class=premium>The seven members of TCATC — who hail from across the country — are quarantining and getting tested before they move into the house, Spencer said. They'll form a pod, getting tested regularly and interacting only with outsiders who have been confirmed to be COVID-19 negative within 72 hours.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Stacy Thiru. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Stacy Thiru/Whalar.</span></span></figure><p class=premium>In its pitch to brands, the group says it will highlight COVID-19-safe practices in videos, like wearing a mask and getting tested.</p><p class=premium>"The house they'll be in has an expansive yard and a lot of outdoor area, so we anticipate having a few special celebrity guest stars in and out in a very safe manner," Spencer said.
