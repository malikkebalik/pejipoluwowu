Another well-known actor brings him to life instead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billy-butcher-is-out-for-blood-in-the-boys-spinoff>Billy Butcher is out for blood in ‘The Boys’ spinoff</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_51>Billy Butcher may be portrayed by a new actor in The Boys Presents: Diabolical, but he maintains his vendetta from the original series. Diabolical Episode 3, “I’m Your Pusher,” sees Butcher seeking vengeance against another Supe. This time, his target is a hero called the Great Wide Wonder (Michael Cera).</p><p id=par-3_59>According to Butcher, the Great Wide Wonder left several underage girls for dead in space — exhibiting yet again that Supes rarely care about who they harm with their fame and power. Butcher gets even by convincing a drug supplier named O.D. (<a href=#>Kieran Culkin</a>) to spike the Great Wide Wonder’s heroine enemas with a substance that will kill him.</p><p id=par-4_33>From his actions alone, Butcher feels no different in animation than he does in the live-action show. And despite being voiced by someone other than Karl Urban, he sounds similar as well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-voices-billy-butcher-in-the-boys-presents-diabolical>Who voices Billy Butcher in ‘The Boys Presents: Diabolical’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Diabolical-Butcher-Frenchie.jpeg><p id=par-5_59>So, who provides the voice for Billy Butcher in episode 3 of The Boys Presents: Diabolical? As it turns out, Jason Isaacs portrays the character in “I’m Your Pusher.” The actor does a solid job of capturing one of the franchise’s most iconic characters. He sounds exactly as he should. Some viewers may not even notice the shift.</p><p id=par-6_56>Isaacs is well known for his villainous stints as Lucius Malfoy in the <a href=#>Harry Potter movies</a> and Captain Hook in 2003’s Peter Pan. He has no shortage of acclaimed films and series under his belt. And believe it or not, the actor has done a fair amount of voice acting before signing on for Diabolical.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-isaacs-does-a-fair-amount-of-voice-acting>Jason Isaacs does a fair amount of voice acting</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_54>Many will connect Jason Isaacs to his live-action roles, but the actor has done a good amount of voice acting prior to The Boys Presents: Diabolical. Before playing Billy Butcher, Isaacs lent his voice to several beloved animated series. He’s held prominent roles in <a href=#>Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, Star Wars: Rebels, and Castlevania.</p><p id=par-8_53>Highlighting his penchant for playing villains, Isaacs portrayed General Zhao in The Last Airbender, The Inquisitor in Star Wars: Rebels, and The Judge in Castlevania. And although Butcher isn’t a villain, he’s got a dark side that aligns with Isaacs’ other characters. Perhaps that’s why he brings him to life so impressively.</p><p id=par-9_10>The Boys Presents: Diabolical is currently streaming on Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm6ayq12lv6a%2FxKerrGWUnq6ju8uimpqkXay1sHnVqKCcnaNir6q4y7Jkm62kmLWmvo2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
