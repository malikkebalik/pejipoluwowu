Fernando Valenzuela began playing baseball professionally in 1977, pitching for various teams in the Mexican Central League. But he was best known for being drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers and going on to pitch one of the most successful rookie seasons ever.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Fernando Valenzuela was born on November 1, 1960, in Etchohuaquila, a small town in Sonora, Mexico. Although his birth date was listed as 1960, there was some question as to whether this was true. He was one of 12 children to Avelino and Maria, who were poor farmers who worked the land with the help of their kids.</p><p>He grew up playing baseball and was initially scouted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1979. But Valenzuela's journey to the major leagues was not easy; He played in the Mexican leagues for several teams before being signed by the Dodgers in 1980.</p><h2 id=mlb-career><strong>MLB Career</strong></h2><p>Valenzuela made his MLB debut in 1980, and he quickly made a name for himself by winning his first eight games and helping lead the Dodgers to the World Series. He became the first player to win both the Cy Young Award and the Rookie of the Year Award, and he became the first rookie to lead the league in strikeouts. He continued to dominate on the mound for the next several years. Valenzuela was known for his unorthodox delivery and devastating screwball, which baffled hitters throughout the league.</p><p>Over the course of his 17-year professional career, Valenzuela played for six teams (Los Angeles Dodgers, California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres, and St. Louis Cardinals), but he is best known for his time with the Dodgers. During his time with the team, he won a Cy Young award, a Gold Glove award, and was selected to six All-Star games. He also helped lead the Dodgers to a World Series championship in 1981.</p><p>Eventually his play became inconsistent, and he attempted multiple comebacks but left Major League Ball for good in 1997. He has since played briefly for the Mexican League, but primarily focuses on Spanish-language sports broadcasting and coaching.</p><p>Valenzuela finished his MLB career with a 173-153 record, a 3.54 ERA, and 2,074 strikeouts. He is also a member of the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-199278 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fernando-Valenzuela.jpg alt="Fernando Valenzuela" width=594 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-199278 class=wp-caption-text>Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>In 1987, Fernando Valenzuela signed the wealthiest contract for a pitcher in league history at the time when he inked a three-year, $5.5 million deal with the Dodgers. His annual salary of $1.83 million and 1988's $2.05 million also set records for a pitcher.</p><p>Over his 17 year career, Valenzuela earned around $17.3 million in salary alone.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Fernando Valenzuela married Linda Burgos in 1981, and the couple had four children together. One of his son's, Fernando Jr., played in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations as a first baseman.</p><p>In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers organization as a broadcaster. And in 2015, he became a naturalized American citizen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2ielae7orrDqGSvmZyau7vBxKWYZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
