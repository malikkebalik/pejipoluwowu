Ava looked nervous as Nina glared in her direction.</p><p>In Anna Devane’s (Finola Hughes) office, Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) begged her to turn Dex down since Sonny would take him out if he became a cop.</p><p>Anna argued that Sonny wouldn’t go after a police recruit, but Josslyn disagreed since Sonny had an FBI agent beaten up.</p><p>Although Josslyn didn’t have proof, she thought it was obvious what happened and tried to convince Anna to reject Dex for a position.</p><p>Anna insisted it’d be Dex’s decision if he got accepted, so Josslyn painted a picture of what would happen when they held Dex’s funeral.</p><p>Josslyn suggested when that day came, they’d both know Anna did nothing to save Dex.</p><p>After Josslyn warned Anna not to hand her the flag from Dex’s coffin, she stormed out.</p><p>Anna summoned Molly Lansing-Davis (Kristen Vaganos) soon after, so Molly looked over the files regarding Cyrus Renault’s (Jeff Kober) beating and the almost hit on him at the hospital.</p><p>Molly thought someone else could make a good case against Sonny, but she wanted to recuse herself since Sonny was her uncle and her sister’s father.</p><p>This was a conflict of interest, but Anna was bizarrely adamant that Molly be the one to take the case since she’d be the fairest.</p><p>Our predictions hint that Molly may have no choice but to go along with what Anna wants, so we’ll bring you updates on all the trouble that’s brewing.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say some terrible legal news seems to be brewing for Sonny!</p><p>CDL will have other great <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, predictions, news and updates to read up on, so make us your go-to GH source.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2apnpuRpXqnvsidmLJlkaW%2FqriManBmopGovK%2B%2FjK2YrayfpHq0wM6rsGain6jArcXNrGSfrZ6av6K4jLCYq6aZo7RuusinmKxlo5a5pnnEp6man5WoerS7zaewaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
