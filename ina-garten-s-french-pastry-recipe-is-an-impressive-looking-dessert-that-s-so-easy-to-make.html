The Barefoot Contessa star shared how even <a href=#>she thought French pastry was “daunting”</a> but that’s actually not the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ina-garten-recipe.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ina-garten-shared-her-easy-pastry-dough-recipe>Ina Garten shared her easy pastry dough recipe</h2><p id=par-2_69>During an episode of Barefoot Contessa, Garten shared her <a href=#>philosophy for entertaining friends</a> which makes it easier for her as the host. “One of my mottos is: my friends don’t have more fun if I spent the day making dessert,” she explained. If it’s a complicated dessert, she’ll pick something up from the bakery. “Or if I want to make it easy, I’ll make profiteroles at home,” she added.</p><p id=par-3_47>“I have to admit, I used to think of making French pastry as really daunting,” Garten confessed. “But I found if you can make one simple thing, Pâte&nbsp;à&nbsp;Choux, which is a sweet dough, I can make lots of different things. And today I’m going to make profiteroles.”</p><p id=par-4_65>The dough is simple enough to make. Garten started by melting butter and milk with a pinch of salt in a saucepan, “heated until just below the boiling point.” Then she added flour and stirred the ingredients with a wooden spoon over low heat for two minutes until it came together as dough. “It will start to coat the bottom of the pan,” she noted.</p><p id=par-5_18>She dumped the dough into a food processor and added eggs, then pulsed it until everything was combined.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-garten-shared-an-easy-hack-for-perfect-puffs>Garten shared an easy hack for perfect puffs</h2><p id=par-6_52>Garten put the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip, then piped mounds of the pastry onto parchment-lined baking sheets. The process is forgiving, as Garten noted, “The good news is, if you make a mistake just take the dough, put it right back in the pastry bag.”</p><p id=par-7_16>“The other good news is you can make them in advance and freeze them,” she added.</p><p id=par-8_32>Garten then showed a trick to flatten each mound of dough to remove the “tips” left from the pastry bag — she dipped a finger in water and pressed each tip down.</p><p id=par-9_22>The Barefoot Contessa star baked the profiteroles in a 425 degree Fahrenheit oven for 20 minutes until “big and puffed and golden.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ina-garten-made-a-simple-chocolate-sauce-for-the-french-pastry-puffs>Ina Garten made a simple chocolate sauce for the French pastry puffs</h2><p id=par-10_52>Garten had a <a href=#>simple chocolate sauce</a> recipe to top the French pastry puffs. “Anything tastes better with chocolate sauce on it,” she said as she poured heavy cream into a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. She added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cream and stirred until the chocolate melted.</p><p id=par-11_18>She noted that it’s “a good all-purpose chocolate sauce — good over ice cream for a last-minute dessert.”</p><p id=par-12_27>Garten added honey and hot prepared coffee to the sauce, stirring to combine. “So now the chocolate has a really nice depth of flavor,” she explained.</p><p id=par-13_42>To assemble the profiteroles, she sliced each cooled pastry in half horizontally and placed a scoop of softened ice cream on the bottom. She placed the “lid” of the pastry on top of the ice cream and drizzled each with chocolate sauce.</p><p id=par-14_10>The full recipe is available on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a> website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r62MoJirrJWjeqe%2BxKeaoWWglsC1vthmqZ6bmaWybrXMqameq6Oew6Z5y6impKGenHqlsdKsnKusXZqutMWNoaumpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
