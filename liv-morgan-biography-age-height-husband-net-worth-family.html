On the January 13, 2016, episode of NXT, Morgan competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to Bayley's NXT Women's Championship, which was won by Carmella. On the August 17 episode of NXT, she competed in a six-woman tag team match, along with Carmella, and <a href=#>Nikki Cross</a>, in which they defeated Daria Berenato, <a href=#>Mandy Rose</a> and <a href=#>Alexa Bliss</a>. On the August 31 episode of NXT, Morgan picked up her first televised singles win, defeating Aliyah. On the September 14 episode of NXT, Morgan defeated Rachel Fazio in singles competition via submission, and would issue a challenge to the NXT Women's Champion Asuka. The following week, however, Morgan was submitted by Asuka in under a minute, and would afterwards begin a rivalry with The Iconic Duo (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), with both women confronting her following her match, leading to match between Morgan and Kay two weeks later, with Kay picking up the victory after interference by Royce. On the October 26 episode of NXT, she interrupted a match between Kay and Aliyah by attacking Royce, causing a distraction that allowed Aliyah to defeat Kay. Morgan went on to compete against Royce on the November 16 episode of NXT, which ended in a disqualification after Kay interfered in the match, attacking Morgan and Aliyah until <a href=#>Ember Moon</a> made the save. The three faced off in a six-person tag team match against Kay, Royce, and Daria Berenato on the November 23 episode of NXT, with Morgan's team coming out victorious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfoba3ecyoqaCZng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
