She met Robert De Niro in 1989 at a restaurant in lower Manhattan. They married in 1997</p><p>Grace and Robert have two children: son Elliot (born 1998) and daughter Helen Grace (born 2011 through surrogacy).</p><h2 id=divorce-battle><strong>Divorce Battle</strong></h2><p>Grace Hightower and Robert De Niro separated in 2018. Robert had previously filed for divorce back in 1999, but they later reconciled.</p><p>In June 2019 Grace filed legal documents in a Manhattan court that claimed <a href=#>Robert De Niro's net worth</a> was at least <a href=#>$500 million and that he earned $250 – $300 million</a> between 2004 and 2018 alone. Much of Robert's expanding fortune was related to his fabulously successful Nobu restaurant empire and related hotel investments.</p><p>According to the terms of their prenuptial agreement, in the event of a divorce Robert would pay Grace $1 million per year in any year that he makes at least $15 million. If his income declines, the support declines proportionally.</p><p>In July 2020, as the divorce raged on, Grace filed a complaint with the court stating that Robert had unfairly cut her monthly American Express allowance from $100,000 down to $50,000. De Niro's response claimed that due to the COVID-19 crisis his income has dried up and his business empire is in free fall. He reportedly had to borrow $500,000 to help cover part of Nobu's mounting debts. His lawyers claimed that Nobu lost $3 million in April and $1.9 million in May. His lawyers also claimed that <a href=#>De Niro would be "lucky if he makes $7.5 million" in 2020</a>.</p><p>Hightower's lawyers claimed that Robert was using the COVID crisis "to stick it to his wife financially".</p><p>The judge in the case ultimately decided that reducing the Amex allowance to $50,000 wasn't unreasonable but also ordered Robert to pay Grace $75,000 to help her find a summer house, since Robert is currently living in their former primary home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLSzrcKeZKGhl53BsMPEq2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
