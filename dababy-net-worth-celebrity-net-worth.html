DaBaby's debut studio album, 2019's "Baby on Baby," was certified Platinum and reached #7 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, #2 on the Top Rap Albums chart, and #3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. His follow-ups, 2019's "Kirk" and 2020's "Blame It on Baby," also went Platinum, and both topped the "Billboard" 200, Top Rap Albums, and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. DaBaby is known for hit singles such as the 4× Platinum "Suge," 3× Platinum "Bop," and 5× Platinum "Rockstar" (featuring <a href=# title="Roddy Ricch Net Worth">Roddy Ricch</a>). DaBaby directed his "Ball If I Want To," "Red Light Green Light," and "Giving What It's Supposed to Give" music videos as well as Rich Dunk's "Gas Gas" and "Demon" videos and Stunna 4 Vegas' "Play U Lay" video. In 2017, he launched the record label Billion Dollar Baby Entertainment.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>DaBaby was born Jonathan Lyndale Kirk on December 22, 1991, in Cleveland, Ohio. He is the youngest of three sons, and in 1999, the family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. DaBaby graduated from Vance High School in 2010, then he spent two years at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He has said of his college experience, "I didn't even have a major decided at college. I only went to school for my parents." DaBaby's father passed away in 2019, and his brother Glenn died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2020.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>DaBaby originally released music under the name Baby Jesus, and his music career began in 2015 when he released the mixtape "Nonfiction." He released two more that year, "So Disrespectful" and "The 10 Minute Mixtape," followed by 2016's "God's Work" and "God's Work Resurrected." In 2017, he released six mixtapes: "Baby Talk," "Baby Talk 2," "Billion Dollar Baby," "Baby Talk 3," "Back On My Baby Jesus Shit," and "Baby Talk 4." DaBaby signed with the record label South Coast Music Group after president Arnold Taylor saw him perform in North Carolina clubs. Through South Coast, DaBaby entered into a distribution deal with <a href=# title="Jay-Z Net Worth">Jay-Z</a>'s entertainment company, Roc Nation, to release the 2018 mixtape "Blank Blank." The popularity of that mixtape led to a bidding war among record labels, and DaBaby signed a seven-figure deal with Interscope. He released his debut studio album, "Baby on Baby," on March 1, 2019, and it featured the singles "Suge" and "Baby Sitter" (featuring Offset). "Suge" reached #7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and it earned DaBaby two Grammy nominations.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288496 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DaBaby.jpg alt="DaBaby Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288496 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><p>DaBaby's follow-up, "Kirk," was released on September 27, 2019, and the singles "Intro," "Bop," and "Vibez" were all certified Platinum or higher. In 2019, 22 of his singles made it into the "Billboard" Hot 100, more than any other artist had that year. He released his third studio album, "Blame It on Baby," on April 17, 2020, and the single "Rockstar" topped the charts in a dozen countries and went Double Platinum or higher in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In November of that year, he released the EP "My Brother's Keeper (Long Live G)," a tribute to his late brother, Glenn.

His ex-girlfriend MeMe is the mother of his older daughter, and she has a son, Caleb, from a previous relationship, who DaBaby refers to as "the oldest of my 3." On the topic of religion, he stated, "I'm blessed. I'm covered by the blood of Christ."</p><p>DaBaby started dating American rapper DaniLeigh in 2020. The couple split up in February 2021.</p><p>In 2018, two men who were wielding weapons approached DaBaby while he was shopping with his family at a Walmart in Huntersville, North Carolina. An altercation broke out, and one of the men, 19-year-old Jalyn Craig, died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. DaBaby confirmed that he was involved in the shooting and said that security camera footage would show that he acted in self-defense. In June 2019, he was convicted of carrying a concealed firearm and sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation. In early 2020, he was questioned during a robbery investigation in Miami after members of his crew allegedly robbed and beat up a music promoter who owed DaBaby $10,000. They reportedly stole $80, a credit card, and an iPhone 7. The Miami authorities arrested DaBaby after they discovered that there was a warrant for his arrest in Texas in relation to a battery charge. He was charged with battery in connection with the Miami robbery, but he was released from jail after 48 hours.</p><p>In 2020, DaBaby slapped a female fan while he was making his way to the stage at a concert in Tampa, Florida, which resulted in the crowd booing him. He left the venue without performing a single song, and he later said that he slapped the woman because her phone was too close to his face while recording with the flash on. He stated, "I'm very sorry that there was a female on the other end of that flashlight on their phone. But you know, keep in mind, I couldn't see you because you got the flash this close to me." At Miami's Rolling Loud Festival in July 2021, DaBaby made remarks that some perceived to be homophobic, and his scheduled appearances at Lollapalooza, the Governors Ball Music Festival, Austin City Limits Festival, Parklife Festival, iHeartRadio Music Festival, Day N Vegas, and Music Midtown were canceled. The fashion brand BoohooMAN announced that they would no longer be working with DaBaby due to his remarks, just weeks after the company released his 100-piece summer collection.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>DaBaby has been nominated for eight Grammys, including Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for "Suge" (2020), Best Rap Performance for "BOP" (2021), and Best Rap Song, Best Melodic Rap Performance, and Record of the Year for "Rockstar" (2021). He has earned four MTV Video Music Award nominations, Song of Summer for "Suge" (2019) and "Rockstar" (2020), Best Hip-Hop for "BOP on Broadway" (2020), and Artist of the Year (2020). DaBaby won three ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2020, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Song for "Suge" and Winning R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for "Baby Sitter" and "Cash Shit." He has received 11 BET Award nominations, winning Best Male Hip Hop Artist in 2020, and he won a BET Hip Hop Award for Best New Hip Hop Artist in 2019.
