She began acting as a child, first appearing in the 1994 film&nbsp;North. Johansson rose the ranks in Hollywood with movies such as&nbsp;Eight Legged Freaks&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Lost in Translation</a>. It wasn’t until she was established as a star that she met Jost.</p><p id=par-3_56>Jost started as a writer on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;in 2005. That season, Johansson hosted for the first time. While he remembers her, she doesn’t recall interacting with him until her third stint in 2010. “He was in there partly directing this segment we had to do,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “He seemed very confident at the time.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-got-engaged-in-2019><strong>They got engaged in 2019</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/usweekly/status/1130678351482511361</p></figure><p id=par-4_49>Johansson returned to host SNL again in 2015. But it was her fifth time, in March 2017, where sparks flew between her and Jost. A couple of months later, they were seen spending time together in public. Johansson and Jost walked their first red carpet together later that year.</p><p id=par-5_38>While attending major 2018 events like the Emmys (where Jost was nominated for&nbsp;SNL) and the&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;premiere, Johansson and Jost’s relationship remained strong. In May 2019, not long after&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;premiered, Jost and Johansson went public with their engagement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-johansson-and-jost-married-in-2020><strong>Johansson and Jost married in 2020</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/colin-jost-scarlett-johansson-oscars-2020.jpg><p id=par-6_44>Less than a year after getting engaged, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic struck. “We don’t know when we really can [have the wedding],” Jost said on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WTF with Marc Maron</a>&nbsp;in July 2020. “Who knows when we really want to get people together for a large gathering.”</p><p id=par-7_49>Their eventual surprise wedding was small. So small, in fact, that the paparazzi didn’t know about it. Rather than announce the news via their publicists, a social media post from <a href=#>Meals on Wheels</a> revealed their October wedding, comprised of “an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and loved ones.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scarlett-johansson-and-colin-jost-s-net-worth><strong>Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost’s net worth</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_46>Scarlett Johansson and Colin’s net worth is high — that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. “Money is a taboo topic of conversation,” she told THR regarding her&nbsp;Black Widow&nbsp;salary. “But I will say that, yes, I’m on an equal playing field with my male cohorts.”</p><p id=par-9_71>Naturally, the action star makes a bit more than her husband. When&nbsp;she hosted&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;in 2019, she joked, “If the show’s bad, what are they going to do: Fire my fiance? Oh no, what will we do without his paycheck?” After all, as one of the <a href=#>highest-paid actors in the world</a>, she’s worth around $165 million. Paired with Jost’s $6 million (according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>), that brings them to $171 million between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZaOYrrO4xK2rZqKfna6vv9KopWaZnpl6pLvLoqVmop%2BowbR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
