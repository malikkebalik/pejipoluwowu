Someone got photos of Courteney Cox and her Cougar Town costar Brian Van Holt walking somewhere close to a motel or something. That’s pretty much the basis for Star Magazine’s “Oh, they’re totally f-cking” story. Brian and Courteney hang out together a lot even though Cougar Town has finished filming their season. Oh, and they had dinner together too. Alone. Okay… maybe they are f-cking.</p><p>Cougar Town costars Courteney Cox and Brian Van Holt have been spotted out together four times in less than four weeks since their sitcom wrapped in early April. And Courteney’s husband, David Arquette, was nowhere in sight!</p><p>Star has obtained an exlcusive photo of Courteney and Brian enjoying dinner at Malibu’s Coral Beach Cantina on May 7 without her husband of 10 years and their 5-year-old daughter, Coco.</p><p>“They were drinking beer and having chips and salsa in the back of the outdoor patio,” says an eyewitness at Coral Beach Cantina. “They looked like they were holding hands at the side of their table!”</p><p>Things got even more intimate when the two parted ways after dinner and Brian gave Courteney what appeared to be a kiss goodbye, says the eyewitness.</p><p>Pick up this week’s issue of Star to see our exclusive photo of Courteney and Brian dining out along with a timeline of their other rendezvous.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Star Magazine</a>]</p><p>Would Courteney cheat on David Arquette? If you were married to him, would you? Although David seems like a total space cadet, he also seems like a sweetheart, and he and Courteney have weathered a lot together. But, of course, I never know what’s going on with her. She seems like a strange duck, and even though I might not understand her motives, I’ll admit it could be possible that she’s screwing around.</p><a href=#><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/2/7/5/e/Courtney_Cox_and_b7b4.JPG?adImageId=12913356&imageId=8341023" width=500 height=750 border=0 alt="Courtney Cox and co-star Brian Van Holt stroll on the beach while filming an upcoming episode for Cougar Town with the rest of the cast in LA" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/8/3/6/1/Courtney_Cox_and_c94d.JPG?adImageId=12913366&imageId=8341006" width=500 height=333 border=0 alt="Courtney Cox and co-star Brian Van Holt stroll on the beach while filming an upcoming episode for Cougar Town with the rest of the cast in LA" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/7/7/5/c/Disney_and_ABC_b55b.jpg width=500 height=676 border=0 alt="Disney and ABC Television Group Summer Press Junket 2010" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmamhhbYR3e8islpynpafBprrEspacp6iUtaLCyKeemJmelK6nssCiqZivmam1oLTEq5acp6WcrrOr06iup5eTpMC1rdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
