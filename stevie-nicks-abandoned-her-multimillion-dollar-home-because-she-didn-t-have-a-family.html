I love rainbow lightbulbs. And, also, one should not live without dimmers. Life is all about lighting.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_12>She uses different forms of lighting for ambiance when she’s at home.</p><p id=par-5_64>“I keep a fireplace burning – even when it’s 99 degrees,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>. “I just turn the air-conditioning down. My mother goes crazy. She says, ‘Do you know how much money you spend to keep this house cool, and then you burn fires in every single room? You’re so weird, Stevie.’ A fire creates ambiance. I need that fire. So back off, Mom.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She rarely uses one of her homes</h2><p id=par-6_43>In 2005, Nicks bought a six-bedroom home in the hills of Los Angeles that boasted impressive views of the ocean and the canyon. She reportedly bought the house for $9 million. Nearly immediately after she moved in, she realized she’d made a mistake.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_55>“There was this big family living there that obviously loved this house,” she said, per the book&nbsp;Gold Dust Woman: The Biography of Stevie Nicks&nbsp;by Stephen Davis. “So there was a vibe. And something in me thought,&nbsp;Maybe I can have that. I was not there three days before I thought,&nbsp;What the hell do I do here?”</p><p id=par-8_25>Nicks realized that she loved the family’s dynamic more than the home. The place didn’t hold as much charm for a single person living there.</p><p id=par-9_45>“I was too shallow and stupid to realize that it wasn’t the house I had fallen in love with, but the mom and the dad and the four kids, and the smells of the cooking,” she explained. “So it was a mistake from day one.”</p><p id=par-10_33>Nicks moved back into her oceanfront condo, keeping the house for guests and special occasions, like recording albums. She prefers life this way, as she can hear the ocean from her glass-walled apartment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stevie Nicks is happy with her dogs and godchildren</h2><p id=par-11_38>Though Nicks fell in love with the family who lived in her house before her, she’s content <a href=#>living without a husband</a> or children. She has many godchildren she dotes on, and she maintains a close network of friends.</p><p id=par-12_40>“I live a single woman’s life and yes, I spend a lot of time by myself,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>. “I have a few very close friends, most of them I’ve known forever, and I kind of like it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-13_19>She is open to a new relationship but doesn’t feel that it’s a necessary part of a fulfilled life.</p><p id=par-14_54>“If it were to happen to me I’d be thrilled,” she explained. “But when I’m 90 years old and sitting in a gloriously beautiful beach house somewhere on this planet with five or six Chinese Crested Yorkies, surrounded by all my goddaughters who will at that point be middle-aged, I’ll be just as happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVopxmppmYuLR5wJuYp5yfo7Klecyuo62hnZ65rbXOp2Sdp5yhrrN5x6iknmWYlsOmecWapKKkqWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
