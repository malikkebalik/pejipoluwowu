O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Vanceâ€™s ability to bring the character of Cobra Bubbles to life, which was originally voiced by Ving Rhames, is without question. Thatâ€™s not the issue.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>The issue at present â€” in addition to being yet another live-action adaptation â€” involves accusations from fans that Disney is whitewashing this dark-skinned Hawaiian cast with actors whose skin tones are paler than their animated counterparts. Just last week Disney cast Liloâ€™s older sister Nani with actress Sydney Elizabeth Agudong, and <a href=#>fans were quick to point out the obvious whitewashing</a>.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Then, days later, actor Kahiau Machado was cast as Naniâ€™s love interest, and a similar conversion <a href=#>erupted online</a>. Although Vanceâ€™s casting does not add fodder to this conversation, it nevertheless reaches a fandom that is all but at its witsâ€™ end. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo6Kkn2LAtbXTnJ9mnpGjwG6vwKdkqa2kYrGww81mq6GdXaW2ta%2FHn6aro6NirqfAxKtkraCVYrmqwsRmmJysmaS7br7EppiknV2YrrTA0maaqJqilnqjwcGbo56rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
