Felix Sabates was born in Cuba, and lived in a well-to-do family until his early teens. The government stripped his family of their wealth, however, and everyone escaped to the United States, one member at a time. He was the first to come to the US, and arrived when he was fifteen. He spent the next several years supporting his family by working at various jobs.</p><p>In his early 20s, he found a job as a car salesman and ended up setting several sales records. A businessman approached him and offered him a job as a manufacturer's representative for his company. He was so successful that he subsequently bought the company in 1971. He grew the company to $12 billion in sales annually, and then sold it to his employees in 2000, for a reduced rate, in recognition of how they helped him build the business. He now owns several yachts and the NASCAR competitor SABCO Racing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvFnqOisF2orqOt056qZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
