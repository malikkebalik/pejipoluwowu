Her many years in Hollywood mean she’s no stranger to those who pick apart the appearance of actors in the industry.

One of the characters’ most noteworthy characteristics is that she may or may not have questionable connections that help her get the supplies and other things she needs for her second-grade classroom. The character embodies the no-nonsense, experienced teacher the younger teachers go to for blunt advice. In the pilot episode, Melissa uses a “friend” to acquire new rugs for the staff’s classrooms.</p><p id=par-4_31>In another episode, Melissa flirts with the man who stock’s the Abbott Elementary vending machines. As a divorcee, she’s hesitant. But Melissa knows her worth. “I’m a Philly 11,” she declares.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-walter-s-response-to-those-who-tweeted-about-her-appearance>Walter’s response to those who tweeted about her appearance</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_62>When it comes to the scrutiny that everyone in Hollywood faces, Walter has a good attitude about opinions of her appearance. After a tweet called her “a baddie,” showcasing photos of her in various, projects, Walter retweeted the post, writing, “Omg — I’m blown away. THANK YOU.” She then added, “Also – why was Hollywood making me feel like I was fat?”</p><p id=par-6_85>The conversation didn’t end there. This interaction prompted many to share their own experiences, specifically those who saw the scrutiny in Hollywood in the ’90s and ’00s and internalized that when looking at their own appearance. Walter then cited her book of essays,&nbsp;The Best Thing About My A— Is That It’s Behind Me, which touches on the subject. “Remember — it’s all just fashion,” she told a fan on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. “My bouncy butt is in style after a lifetime of imagery teaching me to hate it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-walter-isn-t-from-philadelphia>Walter isn’t from Philadelphia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_49>Although Lisa Ann Walter plays a convincing Philadelphia native on&nbsp;Abbott Elementary, she didn’t grow up there.

She went to college in Washington D.C., later pursuing a comedy career in New York City.</p><p id=par-8_30>Even though Walter isn’t from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia</a>&nbsp;(or Philly, as they call it in the show), she has her characters’ body confidence as a Sicilian woman.
