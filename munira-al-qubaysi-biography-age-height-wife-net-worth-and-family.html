Its format was also adapted to each of the other three schools of Islamic law. Students of Shaykha Munira who excelled in Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali fiqh each wrote a Fiqh al-ʿIbadāt text that adhered to each of these other schools of fiqh. Women who previously had limited knowledge of Islamic law gained from the precedent of Hajjah Duriyya and the many students she taught who taught many other women and so forth. It is said that when Hajjah Duriyya was prevented from teaching women at a particular mosque in her early days as a scholar, she used her inheritance money to purchase a mosque and build a section attached to it that would be entirely dedicated to women educating women. Her knowledge, humility, charity, and piety made her loved until her death in 2011.</p><p>During her life, she was named the 24th most influential Muslim in the world, and was also named the most influential Muslim woman, according to the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in 2011.</p><p>al-Ḥāfiẓa al-Jāmiʿa Dr. Daʿad al-Ḥusaynī &nbsp;(d. 2009)</p><p>Shaykha Munira's fame spread to women around the world starting in the 1990s. Women came in droves from dozens of countries to learn from Shaykha Munira's students who had become scholars and spiritual mentors in their own right. Thousands and thousands of women learned the Qur'an through Shaykha Munira's students and later went to their home countries to teach hundreds of other women who would also teach others. This exponential impact of Shaykha Munira Qubaysi's work has made her one of the most formative Islamic leaders who shaped Islamic practice in the twentieth century.</p><p>2) The presence of Shaykha Munira's schools became a lifeline for thousands of unmarried women who now had the opportunity for gainful employment in a dignified setting. The capacity to support one's self and do so in an environment that was acceptable to the cultural norms of conservative Syrian society, opened doors for women in ways that they could have never imagined before the 1970s. Working in schools run by women teaching children also became an acceptable form of work for married women who desired to contribute to society outside of their homes.</p><p>Shaykha Munira al-Qubaysi completed a Bachelor’s degree in biology at the University of Damascus in the 1950s in an era when women in hijab studying at universities was either a rarity or entirely non-existent. Damascus of the 1950s was heavily francophone following the experience of French colonialism which meant that upper class urban families shunned outward religious practice such as hijab, and adopted a lifestyle that emulated European colonial ideals. Religiously conservative urban families on the other hand, commonly adopted another extreme in that they prevented their daughters from studying past the sixth or eighth grades and focused on training their daughters with the household skills that would enable them to marry early. Shaykha Munira was a trailblazer in bypassing these polarized societal norms by becoming a model of how women can have “the best of both worlds” by combining religious piety and practice with acquiring secular education and holding professional jobs.</p><p>She was born in 1938 to an Algerian father, Muhammad ʿAlī Ḥusaynī al-Jazāʾirī, who was a religious scholar and spiritual guide. Dr. Da’ad started her career by earning a PhD in mathematics from the Soviet Union. She came back and taught for a while in Algeria before marrying a Syrian man and settling in Damascus where she was appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Damascus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfosKvtdGaZJqkXabCo63YrKA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
