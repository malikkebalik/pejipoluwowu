The actor also starred in movies like <a href=#>John Tucker Must Die</a> and Drive-Thru.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_37>His big break came in 2007, when he began starring as <a href=#>Dan Humphrey</a> in the CW’s teen soap opera Gossip Girl. The show made Badgley a heartthrob and household name, which led to bigger and better roles.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Penn Badgley said he was ‘criminally old’ in ‘Easy A’</h2><p id=par-4_45>In 2010, Badgley was cast opposite <a href=#>Emma Stone</a> in Easy A, a high school comedy about a high school girl who starts pretending to hook up with guys. Things quickly spin hilariously out of control as everyone tries to unravel what’s true and what’s false.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_25>In a recent “Autocomplete” interview for <a href=#>WIRED</a>, Badgley discussed his time working on Easy A; more specifically, how old he was during the film’s production.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_51>“Older than high school,” the actor laughed. “Criminally old to be playing a high schooler.” Badgley guessed that he was “22, at least” during filming, but he was “lifting more weights then.” The actor filmed Easy A in the summer of 2009, meaning he was, in fact, 22 at the time.</p><h2>Penn Badgley said he ‘love[d]’ the comedy in ‘Easy A’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_35><a href=#>Easy A</a> premiered in 2010, and the movie made Badgley an even bigger success with the teenage crowd. It went on to gross $75 million worldwide and win the Critics’ Choice Award for Best Comedy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_38>The Gossip Girl star has only positive things to say about his time on set working on Easy A. He told <a href=#>Collider</a> his role was written “very well” and was “refreshing” to see in a high school comedy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_53>“I personally love that kind of comedy,” Badgley said of Easy A. “It’s a bit of a heightened reality obviously because life isn’t always that funny, but it’s real. It has a certain looseness to it. I would look forward to getting a chance to do that kind of stuff a lot more.”</p><h2 id=h-what-is-penn-badgley-doing-today>What is Penn Badgley doing today?</h2><p id=par-10_37>Following the massive success of <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> and teen movies like John Tucker Must Die and Easy A, Badgley starred in more dramatic movies and shows, like Margin Call, Greetings from Tim Buckley, The Slap, and Cymbeline.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_57>In 2018, Badgley starred in one of his biggest projects to date: the love-obsessed serial killer Joe Goldberg in <a href=#>You</a>. The show initially aired on Lifetime as a miniseries. But You found new life — and new fans — after it went to Netflix and the streamer ended up buying the show and putting out new seasons.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_35>The fourth season of You just hit Netflix, with Badgley’s Joe crossing the ocean and settling in England as he continues to try and find love, unsurprisingly racking up a body count along the way.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9prrNZpmanJehsrp50pqgnWWTp7autc2ao6WxXaS5pXnPpZiyoZ6ceqm1xqFkrJuYpLytsdFmnJqrqWKub7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
