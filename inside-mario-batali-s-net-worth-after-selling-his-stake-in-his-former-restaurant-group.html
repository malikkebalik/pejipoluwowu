However, his success was halted in 2017 after sexual assault and harassment allegations came to light. As a result, Batali has flown largely under the radar the last few years — and even sold his stake in his successful restaurant company. What is the chefs net worth now that he doesn’t have the food empire he once did?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mario-Batali-net-worth.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chef-mario-batali-sold-his-stake-in-his-restaurant-group-back-in-2019>Chef Mario Batali sold his stake in his restaurant group back in 2019</h2><p id=par-2_64>Back in 2017, four women came forward to accuse Batali of sexual harassment and misconduct. Another woman came forward as well, accusing the chef of inappropriately kissing and groping her while taking a selfie. Batali was found not guilty of indecent assault and battery, stemming from the kissing and groping accusations, in May 2022, and the other accusations never made their way to court.</p><p id=par-3_50>The allegations led Batali to make the decision to step away from his restaurant group, which he owned in partnership with Joe Bastianich, back in 2019, per <a href=#>CNN</a>. The two business partners owned 16 restaurants at the time; the amount of money involved in Batali selling his stake was unclear.</p><p id=par-4_26><a href=#>ABC News</a> reports that in 2021, Batali and Bastianich agreed to pay $600,000 to the former employees who claimed they were sexually harassed in the workplace.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Celebrity chef Mario Batali was found not guilty Tuesday at a bench trial on charges of indecent assault and battery related to the alleged groping of a star-struck patron at a Boston restaurant in 2017. <a href=#>https://t.co/llBznovKEU</a></p>— CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) <a href=#>May 10, 2022</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mario-batali-is-still-worth-an-estimated-25-million>Mario Batali is still worth an estimated $25 million</h2><p id=par-5_38>Despite that the accusations saw Batali fall out of favor with the public, his net worth is still quite high.

Plus, he had several shows on Food Network, including Molto Mario and Iron Chef America, which certainly helped his income. Batali also has published a number of cookbooks.</p><p id=par-7_38>While he might not be making as much money now, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> still suggests he’s worth at least $25 million.

Natali Tene accused the chef of inappropriately touching her while the pair took selfies at a bar. Ultimately, Batali was found not guilty of the misconduct. Batali had waived his right to a jury (which meant a judge would rule on the case), and, according to <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>, Judge James Stanton found that the evidence suggested money was a motive in Tene’s testimony.</p><p id=par-9_25>It’s unclear what the future holds for Batali’s reputation.
