So in this post, you can get all the information related to his life.</p><h2><strong>Who is Ferdinand Berthier’s Wife?</strong></h2><p><strong>It is not yet officially whether Ferdinand Berthier was married or not before his death.</strong> Some social media sites claim that he was married to Marie-Louise Chaudey in 1837, but there is no official confirmation related to it.</p><p><strong>If you want to know about other stars’ personal lives then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><p>Ferdinand Berthier’s marital status is not yet confirmed. Till then you can read about him in the below paragraphs.</p><h2><strong>From Where did Ferdinand Berthier Get Education?</strong></h2><p>Berthier was a young student when he first enrolled in the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris in 1811, while the institution was run by Abbé Roch-Ambroise Sicard. Berthier was born in the French village of Louhans in the Saône-et-Loire region in 1803.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kevin-McCarthys-Net-Worth-6.jpg><p><strong>He relocated from the rural south-east of France to pursue basic literacy and technical training in order to become an artisan. </strong>His teacher Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, a hearing man who had studied French Sign Language and written the first comprehensive analysis and defense of the language had an impact on him.</p><p>Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc, two significant deaf pupils at the school who went on to become teachers had an impact on Berthier as well. Berthier was one of the more experienced instructors at the institution by the time he was 27 years old.</p><h2><strong>Which Organization Did Ferdinand Berthier Establish?</strong></h2><p>The Société Centrale des Sourds-muets, the first organization to advocate the concerns of the deaf community, was formally established the following year after Berthier petitioned the French government for permission to form it in late 1837.</p><p>The organization sought to bring together all the deaf spread across the globe… to put speaking and deaf men of intelligence and heart in rapport with each other, no matter the distance, no matter the difference in language, culture and laws.</p><p><strong>Berthier’s organization gave deaf employees a chance to plan and go to adult education programs as well as a practical way to support one another through mutual aid.</strong> As a fierce advocate for deaf identity and sign language in a repressive social and political environment, Berthier managed to maintain a delicate balance.</p><p>He also authored volumes on deaf history and culture, highlighting poets and painters who used sign language during the period.</p><p>As of yet, this much is known related to Ferdinand Berthier. When we get any information we will share it with you.</p><p>You can<a href=# rel=noopener> follow us on Twitter</a> for more information related to other stars’ personal life including their kids, spouses, marriage, relationship status and more updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxyhY6fnKucmaOur7CMm5yrrJiesrN51qKdnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
