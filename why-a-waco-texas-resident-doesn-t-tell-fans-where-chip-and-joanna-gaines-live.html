Unfortunately, some locals aren’t thrilled with Chip and Joanna. Here’s why one resident doesn’t tell fans where to find the couple.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where do Chip and Joanna Gaines live now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-2_64><a href=#>Chip and Joanna Gaines live full-time in Waco</a>, Texas, in 2023. The 1700-square-foot farmhouse they initially purchased in 2012 is perfect for the Fixer Upper couple and their five kids, as it sits on 40 acres of land. While Chip and Joanna seem to love Waco and the community they continue to build in the small city, they’ve discussed other options for their future.</p><p id=par-3_80>“Waco is our meet in the middle spot: half big city, half tropical – maybe not,” Chip told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. “We talk about it. We’ve been to Kansas City a lot recently and have just fallen in love with that community … Salt Lake, every time we go there it just kind of really inspires us. Obviously New York City for Jo. There are a few cities across the country that we would possibly consider if Waco did not work out.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-waco-texas-resident-doesn-t-tell-fixer-upper-fans-where-the-famous-couple-live>A Waco, Texas, resident doesn’t tell ‘Fixer Upper’ fans where the famous couple live</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_38>Many Waco, Texas, residents are open to the tourism that Chip and Joanna Gaines brought to their community. But others believe the Fixer Upper couple’s stronghold on the city has caused Waco to lose some of its charm.</p><p id=par-5_72>A journalist with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a> spoke to restaurant server Robyn Ritter working in downtown Waco. Ritter said she lived in the Waco area on and off for two decades, and she frequently deals with tourism due to the location of the cafe she works at. Tourists will often ask Ritter where Chip and Joanna live, and she won’t tell them, as she believes Waco is so much more than just the Gaines family.</p><p id=par-6_11>“Waco isn’t Magnolia,” she explained. It’s a town that’s really complicated.”</p><p id=par-7_29>While she doesn’t want tourists to focus solely on Magnolia, she admits that Waco remains “a great place to live. The growing pains are just harder than I expected.”</p><p id=par-8_56>Luke Whyte, a Fixer Upper affiliate who owns Waco Tours, also talked about respecting Chip and Joanna’s “privacy” despite running tours that showcase Magnolia. “We want to showcase our city, not because of the fame and notoriety of individuals, but because of the story that we think matters to all people coming through town,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The population of Waco continues to increase</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_60><a href=#>Chip and Joanna Gaines’ domination over Waco, Texas</a>, has caused a population boom.

In 2019, that number rose to 135,858. In 2021, the number rose again to 139,594.</p><p id=par-10_37>Hopefully, the Gaines family can strike a balance with the locals and the tourists to keep the small city of Waco in perfect balance — but it certainly seems like some longtime Waco residents have mixed feelings.</p><p id=par-11_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEoq%2FOZquesJGoerOx0qKbnqakYrGwsdKnq2aslaG5brLAp6pmm5ievW62zpqlp5ldnK6qusSsZKWhppp7qcDMpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
