"And the only girl who gets disqualified is a mixed-race girl with rounder, curvier features."</p><p data-elm-loc=5 class=premium><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel><span style=color:#000>6 times women were 'dress coded' in real life</span></a></p><p data-elm-loc=5 class=premium>The school is <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>now reviewing Friday's swim meet</a>. At the time, the student's coach contested the referee's decision. That request was denied. The school expects the coach to appeal the referee's call.</p><h2 class=premium>This isn't the first time this student's body has been targeted, her mother says</h2><p class=premium>The teen's mom, Meagan Kowatch, told <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>KTUU</a> that she also wants Friday's disqualification overturned. Kowatch told KTUU that this ref had also targeted her younger daughter over the fit of her swimsuit the previous year.</p><p class=premium>And it's not the first time the teen who was disqualified has been targeted over her body. In September of 2018, another parent took pictures of the girl's backside and sent it to other parents to demonstrate that her swimwear was "inappropriate," the Washington Post reported.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>On Monday, the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>school district released a full timeline of events</a>. They noted that at the time, the "assistant principal indicated to the parent who took the photographs that it was not permissible for him to take pictures of others' children and that he should stop immediately."</p><p class=premium>Langford told the Washington Post that the parent who took those pictures was out of line.</p><p class=premium>"We have a term for it — it's called a suit wedgie," she said. "And wedgies happen. It's uncomfortable. No one's going to walk around that way intentionally."</p><p class=premium>In a post published to <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Medium</a>, Langford put it simply: "If you do not like the way that swimsuits fit on these girls' bodies then don't look; they are minors, children, and no one should be looking at them anyway."</p><p class=premium>The National Federation of State High School Associations, which presides over high school sports in Alaska, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>requires that girls' swimsuits</a> "cover the buttocks and&nbsp; breast." According to the Anchorage's Dimond High School website, the district "has made deliberate efforts over the last year to ensure athletes' uniforms meet the regulations." This year, the team purchased new swimsuits for each member of the team, the district said.&nbsp;</p><p data-elm-loc=16 class=premium>"If the suit was a problem, they all should have been disqualified," Langford said. "But they weren't."</p><ul class="read-more-links premium"><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel>A Georgia elementary school displayed posters of 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate' hairstyles for black students</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel>A high school canceled its spirit week after an unofficial 'thug day' was called out for having racist undertones</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel>A high school forbade girls from wearing pants to their graduation ceremony.
