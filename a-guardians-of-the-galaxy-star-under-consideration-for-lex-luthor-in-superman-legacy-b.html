Recommended Videos As a James Gunn project, the launchpad for the revamped DCU is destined to feature at least a smattering of his regular collaborators, but Variety’s Justin Kroll has added further fuel to the fire by claiming that when it comes to Lex Luthor, the studio’s co-CEO “has been talking to one of his Guardians for the part."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He might be bald, but that would terrible. Chukwudi Iwuji was Gunn’s go-to antagonist in both Peacemaker and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the latter making it abundantly clear </a>he can be a formidable, fearsome, and three-dimensional comic book villain.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Dave Bautista has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already admitted he’d be open to tackling Luthor</a>, which would be a fascinating choice that would allow him to stretch his dramatic chops even further. Chris Pratt? Nope. Sean Gunn? Hopefully not. Sylvester Stallone? Interesting, but too old. Nathan Fillion? No chance. Michael Rooker? He’ll be there, but it’s doubtful.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=false>That leaves one contender standing, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and it would be the biggest shocker for obvious reasons</a>; Michael Rosenbaum. The Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 alum is a close friend of Gunn’s, and played an excellent (Lexcellent?) iteration of the character on Smallville, although the divided DC fandom would no doubt be up in arms were that particular rug-pull to happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGafpZa%2FpbXAp6pmp5ZiwamxjKCYpZmornq0wMCrZK6mlJq%2Fbq%2FOp6qinJWnrrW1zqdkn6eiYrmmxIylrK2gn6d6qrqMrKypnaKirq95y56empupYq%2B2wIywn6KbmGK8r7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
