Last year initial police reports insisted there was no suicide note left by Robin Williams, and he offered up no explanation or final wishes before he committed suicide. But, according to this week’s edition of <a rel=nofollow href=#>GLOBE Magazine</a>, there was a suicide note – actually there were multiple suicide notes!</p><p>GLOBE Magazine reveals, “Williams often wrote little notes to himself as a kind of therapy. Robin scribbled words on pieces of paper and left them all over the place. On their own, they really didn’t make much sense. But when you look at them as a whole in light of the suicide, Robin was clearly reaching the point where he couldn’t take the pain and anguish of his life any longer.”</p><p>According to GLOBE Magazine’s insiders, there were <a rel=nofollow href=#>three different pieces of paper </a>found that Robin&nbsp;Williams had scribbled on during the days leading up to his suicide. The first notes stated, “I’m done with that.” The second not read, “Time to go.” Robin’s final scribbling stated, “No more to come.” Although it is not a traditional suicide note, and doesn’t offer much closure on Robin’s death – the notes do reveal that Robin was very tortured and unhappy, and although we miss him greatly it is somewhat comforting to know that he is no longer suffering and going through the hellish battles with his mental health and substance abuse. And, those notes can also put to rest the conspiracy theories that <a rel=nofollow href=#>Robin William’s greedy wife Susan Schneider </a>had something to do with his death, and his suicide was all some sort of elaborate cover-up.</p><p>What do you think of the bizarre suicide notes Robin Williams left behind? Were they cries for help, if someone found them ahead of time could he have been saved? Or was his death inevitable?
