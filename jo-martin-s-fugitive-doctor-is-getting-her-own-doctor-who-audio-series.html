Although we don’t know exactly when to expect them to come out just yet, Volumes One and Two are available to pre-order <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Big Finish website</a>.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>In response to the announcement, Martin had the following to say:</p><p>“Big Finish do amazing work – they are a vital part of the fandom. I’m over the moon to be joining this iconic show. I can’t wait to see what stories they have in store for the Fugitive Doctor.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/doctor-who-fugitive-doctor.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Martin first appeared in 2020’s “Fugitive of the Judoon” as Ruth, an ordinary human woman who was revealed to be a past incarnation of the Doctor in disguise, hiding from her people after going on the run. She’s since returned for cameos in 2020’s “The Timeless Children” and in 2021’s “Flux: Chapter Three”. Fans have always been frustrated that her appearances have been limited like this, so this audio series is definitely exciting news.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>It also follows <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement earlier this year</a> that Titan Comics is working on a solo comic series for the Fugitive Doctor, titled Doctor Who: Origins, which will further explore how she fits into the show’s canon. The first issue hits shelves this June.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>Though characters and concepts from her tenure will continue to live on in the Whoniverse, Jodie Whittaker’s time in the TARDIS draws to a close. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Her final Doctor Who episode</a> airs sometime this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yru4ymmKusmaPAbrLUoKCtoaaaeqW7wq2mq2WZqHqosdOtoKefXZ2ys3nOsKVmnJ%2BYwbC%2BjLCfqGWRqrGqu4ysnKuhlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
