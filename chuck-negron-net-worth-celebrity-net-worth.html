Chuck Negron is best known as one of the three lead vocalists of the band Three Dog Night.</p><p>Chuck Negron was born on June 8, 1942, in New York City. He grew up in The Bronx, where he generally divided his time between two passions: singing in local doo-wop groups and playing basketball. Basketball led to Chuck being recruited to play college basketball in Santa Maria, California at Allan Hancock College and later at California State University, Los Angeles. Eventually though, Negron would turn to singing professionally.</p><p>While in Los Angeles, he met fellow singers <a href=#>Cory Wells</a> and <a href=#>Danny Hutton</a>, with whom he formed the band Three Dog Night in 1968. The trio became one of the most successful American rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They enjoyed massive stardom, scoring 18 consecutive Top 20 singles and number ones like "Mama Told Me Not to Come", "Joy to the World" and "Black and White."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-328268 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chuck-Negron.jpg alt="Chuck Negron Net Worth" width=900 height=1118 sizes="(max-width: 1572px) 100vw, 1572px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-328268 class=wp-caption-text>Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</p><p>Fame, success and rock and roll lifestyle took a heavy toll on Negron, leaving him with a serious heroin addiction by the time Three Dog Night disbanded in 1976. It took him around 126 pounds and more than 30 rehab programs to quit his 2,000-dollar-a-day habit that held him firmly in its grip for almost two decades.</p><p>Early in the 1990s, he overcome his addiction and embarked on a solo career, recording three studio albums: "Am I Still In Your Heart" (1995), "Joy to the World" (Christmas CD â€“ 1996) and "Long Road Back" (1999). His fourth solo effort was a double CD set titled Chuck Negron â€“ Live In Concert, released via Sindrome Records. Negron also penned his autobiography "Three Dog Nightmare" (1999), which tells his healing path from heroin addiction to his turning to God in desperation. Today, Chuck Negron is a devoted family man who spends his time performing, lecturing, and working with anti-drug organizations like Musicians Assistance Program (MAP), MusiCares and Cri-Help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyktNScomamlZy%2FsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
