According to the text messages, Brown wrote that the woman was a "super broke girl" and shared pictures of her kids and a link to her Instagram account.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287702 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174834963.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-287702 class=wp-caption-text>Michael Reaves/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sports Illustrated </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>published a story</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with this latest news after </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>posting a piece</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> on Brown and his history earlier in the week. The woman, whose name has not been shared, claims Brown hired her to paint a mural outside of his Pittsburgh home. When she rejected his sexual advances, she was fired.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The woman's lawyer has reached out to the NFL to ask for their assistance in dealing with Brown.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brown's name also appeared in reports alongside Dr. Victor Prisk, who's suing the receiver for $11,500 in unpaid fees. Brown is featured in a video farting in Prisk's face multiple times, laughing about it after showing up three hours late for an appointment.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In less than two weeks time, Brown became too much of a distraction for the Patriots. And that was after just a few months with the Oakland Raiders.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brown's downfall caused him to lose out on $30 million guaranteed from the Oakland Raiders. He could potentially earn just $158,333 for the whole year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That all depends on what happens with Brown's signing bonus with the Patriots. He was set to earn $9 million guaranteed, with $5 million due this coming Monday and the rest in January.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But the Patriots may not have to pay him at all. Per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, because Brown didn't disclose his impending sexual assault lawsuit, New England likely has just cause in releasing him. If that proves to be the case, Brown won't make any money from his tenure with the Patriots.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Antonio Brown likely forfeits $9M signing bonus from Patriots b/c of a contract clause calling for players to disclose situations preventing availability, per league source. This could lead to a grievance, but source says that money is 'gone.' Brown was due $5M Monday</p><p>— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) <a href=#>September 20, 2019</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Either way, going from $30 million guaranteed in March to, at best, less than a third of that amount, is a huge drop for Brown. That's not even factoring in his sponsorship deals that have been terminated, and most importantly, his impending legal issues.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brown had one of the quickest falls from grace the league has ever seen. And now, he may never play in the NFL again.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlraeenrxurtGorqdlk6TCrbCMoKZmnqKkum5%2Fj2akoqScnryvecaumKuZnqmyprCMraZmoqWowW671Z6pZmllbX1xfIyipWasmJp6tLzAp2Sonl2otrl5zKilraCjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
