However, they rewrote it for Yeoh when the "Rush Hour" star turned it down.</p><p class=premium>"It was written for a man," she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>CNN</a> recently. "Whenever filmmakers tell the story, they also have to be mindful that it is showbusiness. 'I have to write something that somebody will make it into a film.' And so, they wrote it like that way with Jackie and me as the wife."</p><p class=premium><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The Oscar nominee</a> continued: "So it was completely [role-reversed]. And I remember Jackie text me and said, 'Congratulations. You realize that your boys came to see me first?' and I'm like, 'Thank you, bro. You did me a huge favor.'"</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Michelle Yeoh won the Golden Globe for best actress. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Invision</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Yeoh also said in the interview that Chan's exit from the movie was a "mutual" decision between the Daniels and the Hong Kong actor.</p><p class=premium>"Jackie is very, very busy and he's got so many things going on," Yeoh said. "And I think the Daniels also stepped back and said, 'We're doing something that's already been done before. We should do something differently.' And they both have very strong women in their lives, whether it's their mothers or their partners. So they're very inspired, and they're not afraid of strong women."</p><p class=premium>Yeoh joked that when she first got the script, she prayed that the Daniels were not "certifiably insane" because there are so few lead or big roles that are given to older actors, especially women.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Kelsi Ephraim, Jason Kisvarday, Zak Stoltz, Harry Shum Jr., Stephanie Hsu, Dan Kwan, Jonathan Wang, Michelle Yeoh, Daniel Scheinert, Shirley Kurata, Ke Huy Quan, Paul Rogers, and Jon Read, winners of Best Picture award for "Everything Everywhere All at Once", pose in the press room during the 28th Annual Critics Choice Awards at Fairmont Century Plaza on January 15, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Critics Choice Association</span></span></figure><p class=premium>"It's always the guy that gets to go on the adventure and save the world and rescue your daughter and you think, 'Why can't I do that too?'"
