Personality-wise, they’re completely different. The earthy virgin is more <a href=# class=T3D>serious and reserved</a>. They’re highly organized and function best when everything is moving as it should. The airy water bearer, on the other hand, is a little more chaotic. They’re known for being very unique individuals who play by their own rules and go with the flow. However, both signs have an inner desire to help others. <a href=# class=T3D>Aquarius</a> is the humanitarian of the zodiac, while <a href=# class=T3D>Virgos</a> are driven to serve others. As a couple, these two could go either way. Virgo and Aquarius’ compatibility shows why this earth-air sign pair make a surprisingly OK match.</p><p>“These two signs are very different from one another, with Virgo being mutable earth and Aquarius being fixed air,” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Stina Garbis</a>, professional astrologer and psychic, tells Bustle. “They <a href=# class=T3D>form a minor quincunx aspect</a>, which means they are five signs apart. This is generally neither good nor bad, they just simply coexist. But when we dig deeper into the base characteristics of these signs, you will find how similar they can be.”</p><p>For one, they’re both problem solvers. They like to look at things from every angle in order to come up with creative solutions. With Virgo being a Mercury-ruled sign and Aquarius being an air sign, these two are more logical than emotional. They both enjoy learning and staying on top of current events, so they’ll have a lot of fun going back and forth on issues that matter most to them, and they’ll never run out of things to talk about. According to Garbis, at its best, this can be a relationship full of lively conversations, exploration, and discovery.</p><h2>Virgo And Aquarius’ Sexual Compatibility</h2><p>Despite their different personalities, these two actually have a lot of sexual chemistry. In fact, Garbis says these two make a very exotic sexual couple. “<a href=# class=T3D>Virgo has a fascination with the taboo</a> and Aquarius likes to live it,” she says. “This couple may start off as a friends with benefits situation that leads to something more.”</p><p>They tend to make a good match in bed because they both love trying new things. Virgo may be slower to fully open up about their sexual needs, but once Aquarius proves how open and nonjudgmental they are, the Virgin’s hidden sensual side will come out to play.</p><p>As they grow together, they may even invite other people into the bedroom. Aquarius is all about the nontraditional, and may be willing to explore a more <a href=# class=T3D>polyamorous situation</a>. “Virgo may not agree with this scenario but will keep their motivations secret,” Garbis says. Virgos are happiest when their partner is happy.</p><h3><strong>Virgo And Aquarius’ Emotional Compatibility</strong></h3><p>Emotionally, these two may have a tough time connecting with each other. <a href=# class=T3D>Aquarius is the ultimate freedom-loving sign</a>, who dates because it’s fun or mentally stimulating. According to Garbis, they want “explore the limits of love.” It’s all in an effort for them to understand what love actually is. Virgo, on the other hand, dates for the future. They value security and <a href=# class=T3D>want marriage or a stable long-term relationship</a>.</p><p>“If Aquarius gets bored, they may cause unnecessary drama just to stir things up,” Garbis says. “Virgo wants to serve, desires emotional stability, and may have a hard time finding that in Aquarius, who — while passionate — can also be cold.”</p><p>Although Virgos are very rational, they can only take so much. Aquarius is the type to forget to respond to texts, or go out on their own without telling their partner. They’re not very affectionate, nor do they like constantly reassuring someone of their feelings. In relationships, Virgos tend to go all out for their partner. If they don’t feel like they’re getting the same amount of effort back in return, they may decide the relationship isn’t worth it.</p><h2>Virgo And Aquarius’ Communication</h2><p>When it comes to everyday conversations, Virgo and Aquarius can talk about anything and everything. They both have an interest in keeping up with the news and current events, and will enjoy having a partner to share their thoughts and opinions with. However, when it comes to talking about more personal topics like the future of their relationship or a current issue, that can get pretty complicated.</p><p>“Virgo is more direct while Aquarius likes to beat around the bush,” Garbis says. “There may be some confusion and mixed signals. It’s hard to argue with an Aquarius and they tend to defuse situations very easily, which can be very frustrating for Virgo.” If Virgo can learn how to stand their ground and Aquarius is willing to acknowledge that something is wrong, they can work through any problems that come their way. If not, resentment will grow and ultimately end the relationship.</p><h2>Virgo And Aquarius’ Dating Compatibility</h2><p>At their core, Virgo and Aquarius are very different. As <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Charlotte Kirsten</a>, professional astrologer and the founder of Typically Topical, tells Bustle, Aquarius has a “true rebellious streak running through their veins,” while Virgo is grounded, stable, and “intensely structured” by nature.</p><p>“Ruled by the free-thinking planet Uranus, Aquarius refuses to be pinned down or held back by anything that puts a damper on their innovative side, which can be problematic for the sensible, practical-loving Virgo,” Kirsten says. “If left unchecked, this free-spirited behavior can easily push Virgo away. Not to mention, Virgo’s incessant overthinking can quickly weigh on an Aquarius’ mind. Nothing drives the visionary water-bearing sign into another’s arms quite like indecisiveness.”</p><p>However, it’s not the most incompatible match for either sign. According to Kirsten, they both crave deep love, appreciation, and support in a relationship, which are things both signs can give to the other. Although a romantic relationship between them won’t come easy, hard work, patience, commitment and “some serious compromise” can help increase their chances of creating a relationship that lasts.</p><h2>Virgo And Aquarius’ Friendship Compatibility</h2><p>When it comes to friendship, Virgo and Aquarius’ compatibility is actually pretty good. In fact, Kirsten says these two have the potential to become long-lasting BFFS, especially in an office or community setting.</p><p>“There’s an underlying mutual understanding between these two signs,” she says. “Virgos admire Aquarius’ innovative, progressive and humanitarian side, while Aquarius adore Virgo’s unwavering loyalty, practicality, and emotional sensitivity. Whilst they’re perfect opposites, they can work well in complementing and stabilizing each other’s energy… in small doses."</p><p>Virgo and Aquarius are the type of friends who’ll throw trivia nights or debate for hours on end about controversial topics. According to Garbis, they both offer great advice and can be powerful confidantes for each other. Since Aquarius is a fixed sign and Virgo is a stable earth sign, these two will be very loyal to each other for years to come.</p><h2>Potential Problems In A Virgo & Aquarius Relationship</h2><p>One of the biggest challenges for this relationship is communication. Although they both value open and honest communication in relationships, they have a tendency to skirt certain issues. These two rarely ever talk about their emotions, which may cause resentment to form. According to Garbis, little things may build until someone acts out and blows up.</p><p>“If this couple can be direct with how they are really feeling, they can diffuse problematic scenarios, avoid unnecessary drama, and grow closer together,” Garbis says.</p><h2>Are Virgo & Aquarius A Good Match?</h2><p>Overall, Virgo and Aquarius make an OK match. As Garbis says, this is a “curious” couple. They may be different, but they’ll enjoy doing a lot of things together. They love to explore, study, and talk about the world. They’ll be that couple who tries all kinds of new social media challenges or exercise crazes. These two will also bond through their shared love of helping others. As long they keep talking about things that really matter to them on a personal level, these two can make a long-term relationship work.</p><p>Source</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Stina Garbis</a>, professional astrologer and psychic</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Charlotte Kirsten</a>, professional astrologer and the founder of Typically Topical</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Sep. 15, 2021</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaK6Zp7SwecCqrJqqmarAbsbOnaCam12otqi6jJympqiRqbajtcuiq7JlkajBs7vLqJ6eqqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
