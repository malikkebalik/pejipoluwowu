Typically, swimwear is made from a blend of nylon, spandex, and polyester to provide the necessary stretch and absorbency for water-based activities. However, not all brands design swimsuits for plus-size bodies, which can result in an uncomfortable and ill-fitting garment. It's essential to be intentional about the brands you purchase from, especially as a fat person, as some designers and retailers don't take into account body fat, belly rolls, side-boob, or large butts.</p><p>Plus-size influencer and designer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>Gabi Gregg</a> stresses the importance of quality and fit in plus-size swimwear. "Something might be cute, but the fabrication isn't nice, or it isn't made well," she tells Insider. Working with the retailer Eloquii, Gregg designed a new swimwear collection that prioritizes comfort and support in her designs. "As someone with a larger bust, designing pieces that are actually supportive is always at the forefront of my mind. If I can't personally wear it, I don't want to sell it." In short, when plus-size people design for plus-size shoppers, you get a swimsuit that fits correctly and looks great.</p><p>Caroline Adegun, CEO and lead content producer for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link>The Extended Plus Network</a>, emphasizes individual choice when it comes to selecting a swimsuit. She reminds plus-size folks that their bodies are not anyone else's business and that every body is a bikini body. "Your body is not anyone else's business! It's summer, it's hot outside! We have more fat on our body and as such should be wearing less clothes," she shared to Insider.</p><p>When it comes to selecting a plus-size bikini, coverage is an important factor. "The truth is that the plus-size customer is not a monolith – not everyone wants the same thing," says Gregg. Some people prefer more coverage, while others want something skimpier, she continues. With the increase in brands catering to the plus-size market, there are more options available than ever before, which means you're more likely to find something that suits your personal style and comfort level.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyowcidnKxno6nGrbGOm5ysrF2luba%2FjKygs51dqMSqudaemKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
