As she was a new hire, she was laid off during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Thereafter, driven by her boyfriend's encouragement and her own rants about college life on Snapchat, joined TikTok, and posted her first TikTok on March 24, 2020. Some of her videos where she called out hateful and bigoted content on social media caused her account to lose followers four times, and get deleted once in 2022.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>She recently partnered with the fast-fashion brand Shein in 2022. However, this got her some backlash due to the brand’s unethical business practices. Drew responded to the backlash, saying that sustainable fashion is expensive, and that it currently does not cater to plus-side people or to people who do not belong to high-income communities.</span></p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source: Instagram</figure><p dir=ltr><span>She also recently partnered with the sustainable fashion brand CHNGE, where she promoted T-shirts whose profits would go to helping Ukrainian people affected by the ongoing war between their country and Russia. She and her current partner Pili Tanuvasa have launched a fitness program called “Strong Like Drew”, where she offers workout courses. The program has had two iterations so far. She currently hosts the podcast “The Comment Section” and co-hosts the podcast “Two Idiot Girls” with her sister.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>Due to her rising prominence, Afualo has partnered with more commercial brands like DIRECTV and mattress brand Casper. She has appeared in the magazines Teen Vogue and Rolling Stones, as part of the latter’s Creators Issue. She also recently featured in the ‘Encounters’ column of The New York Times. In 2022, she was chosen as one of TikTok’s 2022 trailblazers, in honor of celebrating AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) Heritage Month.</span></p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source: Instagram</figure><p dir=ltr><span>In January 2023, a live show of Two Idiot Girls, a podcast co-hosted by Drew and her sister Deison, took place at the House of Blues in San Diego. On March 8, 2023, Tubefilter reported that Spotify signed a deal with Afualo for her podcast, The Comment Section, to become a Spotify exclusive starting April 5. The show's first season on Spotify featured notable guests such as Bretman Rock, Meghan Trainor, Shea Couleé, Monét X Change, and Tess Holliday.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>In March 2023, Afualo, along with fellow TikTokers Reece Feldman and Khaby Lame, was invited to cover the 95th Academy Awards pre-show red carpet alongside YouTuber Lilly Singh. During the event, Afualo had the opportunity to interview Jamie Lee Curtis and once again encountered Dwayne Johnson.
