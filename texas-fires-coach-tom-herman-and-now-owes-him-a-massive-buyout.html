After four years, Texas announced it's parting ways with its head coach. The university is expected to hire Steve Sarkisian, currently the offensive coordinator at Alabama, to replace him.

He'll likely find another job elsewhere, whether as a head coach or offensive coordinator. He's had success in both roles, including a 22-4 record in two years at Houston and being named the top assistant coach in the country while at Ohio State.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, Sarkisian returns to his first head coaching role since USC fired him in 2015. That dismissal centered around reports of Sarkisian being intoxicated during a booster club event and pre-practice meetings.
