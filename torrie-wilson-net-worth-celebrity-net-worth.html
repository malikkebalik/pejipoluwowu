This resulted in many years of anorexia nervosa and bulimia.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>After getting over her eating disorders, Wilson entered the fitness competition world. She came in third place in her first fitness competition, and in 1998 won the Miss Galaxy competition and the grace and physique round of the Women's Tri-Fitness Championships.
