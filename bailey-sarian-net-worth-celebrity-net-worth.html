Bailey Sarian &nbsp;is known for her "Murder, Mystery & Makeup" video series, which combines makeup application with true crime stories. She is also known for her podcast "Dark History," which is similarly focused on true crime. Since launching her YouTube channel in 2013, Sarian has amassed over seven million subscribers and more than one billion total views. In 2023 she was one of the highest paid creators in the world with annual income of at least $10 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Bailey Sarian was born on November 26, 1988 in Los Angeles, California. She is of Armenian ancestry. Sarian's mother, a 911 dispatcher, occasionally brought her daughter to work, inspiring Sarian's interest in true crime.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Before launching her YouTube channel, Sarian worked as a social media creator for the cosmetics subscription service IPSY. She also worked with the cosmetics brands Sephora and Urban Decay as a makeup artist.</p><h2 id=youtube><strong>YouTube</strong></h2><p>Sarian started her self-named YouTube channel in 2013. Originally, the channel focused on traditional makeup videos, including tutorials and reviews. In early 2019, Sarian took things in a new direction when she released the first episode of her "Murder, Mystery & Makeup" series, in which she talked about the 2018 Watts family murders while putting on her makeup. The series quickly grew in popularity, due in large part to the overall increase in online consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. From March to the end of 2020, Sarian's channel went from 780,000 subscribers to 3.5 million. At the 11th Annual Streamy Awards in 2021, she won the Beauty subject award. Beyond her own channel, Sarian has also appeared on Netflix's YouTube channel watching mystery movies while applying makeup.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-353400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bailey-sarian.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-353400 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for ipsy)</p><h2 id=dark-history><strong>Dark History</strong></h2><p>Due to the popularity of "Murder, Mystery & Makeup," Sarian launched a true crime podcast in 2021 called "Dark History."
