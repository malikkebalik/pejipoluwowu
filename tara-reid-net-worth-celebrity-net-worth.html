Although Tara Reid began her career as a child actress, she eventually became one of the most recognizable figures in Hollywood. Tara is probably best known for her roles in the "American Pie" film franchise, although she has appeared in many other films. She is also an accomplished television actress who has appeared in a range of shows (both reality TV and normal series).</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tara Donna Reid was born on November 8th of 1975 in Wyckoff, New Jersey. Raised alongside twin siblings and a brother by two teachers, Tara attended a Catholic elementary school before attending high school in New Jersey and Los Angeles. She eventually graduated from an alternative high school in New Jersey. During her childhood, Tara also spent time in Manhattan and attended the Professional Children's School with future actors like <a href=# title="Christina Ricci Net Worth">Christina Ricci</a>, Jerry O'Connell, <a href=# title="Sarah Michelle Gellar Net Worth">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, and <a href=# title="Macaulay Culkin Net Worth">Macaulay Culkin</a>.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Tara Reid started her acting career at the age of six, appearing on the game show "Child's Play." She also appeared in a range of commercials as a child, and by her teen years she was appearing on the show "Saved by the Bell: The New Class." In 1997, Tara moved to Hollywood and landed a breakthrough role in "The Big Lebowski," playing a trophy wife and a former pornstar. She followed up with a role in "Urban Legend" before booking a minor part in "Cruel Intentions."</p><p>Although Reid was an established actress by this point, her true breakthrough came when she appeared in the 1999 film "American Pie." The film reached the number one spot at the box office and elevated her to widespread fame. She later reprised her role in "American Pie 2" and "American Reunion." Although she was massively famous after "American Pie 2," she made an ill-advised decision to join the casts of "Josie and the Pussycats" and "Van Wilder," both of which were critical and commercial flops.</p><p>In 2000, Reid appeared alongside <a href=# title="Richard Gere Net Worth">Richard Gere</a> in "Dr. T & the Women" before landing a role in the series "Scrubs." She drew critical jabs once again after appearing in the film "My Boss's Daughter" in 2003. In 2005, she appeared in "Alone in the Dark."&nbsp; Throughout the next few years, she appeared in a range of direct-to-video films. In 2011, Tara appeared on the reality show "Celebrity Big Brother 8." In 2013, she appeared in the film "Sharknado," later reprising her earlier role in all five of the film's sequels.</p><h2 id=fashion><strong>Fashion</strong></h2><p>As a model, Reid has appeared on the covers of CosmoGirl, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, Maxim, Playboy, Stuff, and FHM.

They lived together in New York City, and Daly eventually proposed. However, one year later the pair split up and called off the engagement. After dating an entrepreneur from Nuremberg named Michael Axtmann for a spell, Tara Reid became engaged once again. Although Axtmann proposed in 2010, later that year multiple sources confirmed that the relationship had ended. She then began dating a businessman named Michael Lillelund, although the relationship quickly fizzled out.</p><p>In 2011, Reid announced that she had wed a financier named Zachary Kehayov, although she later clarified that the two were never legally married. From 2013 to 214, she dated Erez Eisen from the band Infected Mushroom. Although Reid and Dean May participated in "Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars," it was later revealed that they were never in a relationship together.</p><h2 id=plastic-surgery><strong>Plastic Surgery</strong></h2><p>Tara Reid has gone through plastic surgery in the past, and she was left with a deformity in 2006 after a procedure gone wrong. Tara allegedly wanted a six-pack for a movie role, but she was left with a deformed stomach after a problem with the liposuction. The deformity was later corrected by a separate plastic surgeon.</p><h2 id=legal-issues><strong>Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Tara Reid filed a lawsuit against The Asylum, an American independent film company. Reid alleged that her likeness was used without her permission on merchandise for the "Sharknado" film franchise. Tara Reid has specified in her contract that her likeness was not to be used on products relating to alcohol or gambling. After Tara Reid had made it clear she didn't want to endorse such products, the Asylum apparently disregarded the contract and used her likeness anyway. Tara Reid sought $100 million in damages.</p><h2 id=salary-for-8220sharknado8221-films><strong>Salary for "Sharknado" Films</strong></h2><p>As a result of her lawsuit against The Asylum, documents revealing Tara's salary for the "Sharknado" films were made public. According to the documents, Tara Reid was paid $125,000 to appear in "Sharknado 5," and $175,000 to appear in "The Last Sharknado: It's About Time." It's not clear what her salary was for the earlier installments, but one can assume that her salary increased as more films were released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR705qpmmWimralec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
