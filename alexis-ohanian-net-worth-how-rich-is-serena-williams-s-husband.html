Alexis Ohanian is an Internet entrepreneur from the United States. His wife, Serena Williams, is a great tennis player. Few people know that he was one of the people who started Reddit. Few people know that he was worth a million dollars when he was only 23. At one point, he was a failure in both his personal and business lives.</p><p>He is still a member of Reddit’s board of directors. He has also talked about having mental health problems and is ready to help anyone going through the same thing. Serena Williams, his wife, had also said that she was depressed when she was at the top of her game as a tennis player. Both the husband and the wife are very involved in Mental Health. He started Reddit with others in 2005, but he left in 2007. In 2015, he went back to Reddit and stayed there.</p><h2>Alexis Ohanian’s Early Life</h2><p>Alexis Kerry Ohanian was born in Brooklyn, <a href=# rel=noopener>New York</a>, on April 24, 1983, to Anke and Chris Ohanian. After the Armenian Genocide, his grandparents fled to the United States. Ohanian went to high school in Ellicott City, Maryland, at Howard High School. In 2001, when he graduated from high school, he gave a speech to the students.</p><p>Alexis Ohanian graduated from the<a href=# rel=noopener> University of Virginia</a> in 2005. While in college, he started to focus on business and the Internet. He was a member of the business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi. He studied business and history.</p><h2>Reddit</h2><p>After he graduated from college, he went on to start a number of Internet businesses. Ohanian and his friend Steve Huffman first told Y Combinator about the idea for MyMobileMenu. The company didn’t like the idea but pushed the two to think of their next one. In 2005, he helped start Reddit, a news website where users post news stories and rank them. In the summer of 2005, Reddit was one of the first startups that Y Combinator helped to launch. It was bought by Conde Nast a year later for an unknown amount between 10 and 20 million dollars.</p><p>As a member of Reddit’s board of directors, Alexis worked closely with the site. In July 2015, he and Huffman returned to Reddit full-time to run the company, which was now on its own. Ohanian left Reddit in February 2018 to focus on making money as an investor. He also quit Reddit’s board on June 5, 2020, and asked to be replaced by a Black person because George Floyd had been killed. On June 10, 2020, Michael Seibel, a Black business owner, was named to the Reddit board.</p><h2>Other Companies</h2><p>In 2007, Ohanian started Breadpig, an online business that finds or makes “geeky” things and sells them. All of the profits from Breadpig go to organizations that need money, like the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Room to Read, which is building a primary school in Laos. Since 2007, the site has raised more than $150,000. He no longer has anything to do with how Breadpig works daily. He is also the head of marketing for an online travel company called Hipmunk. Ohanian started Das Kapital Capital in June 2010. It is a company that invests in, advises and works with new businesses. Ohanian was named Y Combinator’s Ambassador to the East. Before he quit in 2016, he was also a full-time partner at Y Combinator.</p><h2>Investments</h2><p>In 2010, Ohanian co-founded Initialized Capital and put over $500 million into new companies like Instacart, Opendoor, Zenefitsand Cruise. CB Insights said in 2014 that Ohanian was the best investor in terms of how central he was to his network. In 2019, Alexis put $3 million into a new company for childcare called Kinside. He did this through his company Initialized Capital.</p><h2>Other Projects</h2><p>Ohanian and Lester Chambers of The Chamber Brothers started a Kickstarter in December 2012 to raise money for a new album called “Lester’s Time Has Come.” It made more than $61,000. Two years later, Ohanian used Tilt.com to raise $12,244 for the charity Black Girls Code.</p><p>On October 1, 2013, Ohanian came out with a book, “without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed.” It was the fourth best-selling book, according to the Wall Street Journal. That same year, Ohanian began hosting a weekly online series for The Verge called “Small Empires with Alexis Ohanian.”</p><p>Ohanian and Rayouf Alhumedhi, a teenager, worked together in 2017 to try to get Apple to add a hijab emoji. Alexis helped Alhumedhi set up an AMA where she could discuss her idea and answer critics. On July 17, 2017, Apple released its version of the hijab emoji.</p><p>Alexis has started three podcasts: NYRD Radio in October 2014, Upvoted in January 2015 and Business Dad in January 2020.</p><h2>Activism</h2><p>Ohanian is very committed to net neutrality and keeping the internet open. Ohanian spoke against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate’s PROTECT IP Act in 2010 and 2011. Ohanian led an Internet-based campaign that eventually led to the defeat of the two bills. He spoke to Congress, helped start the national anti-SOPA/PIPA protests in 2012 and spoke at the NY Tech Meetup rally in New York.</p><p>Ohanian also went on the Internet 2012 Bus Tour with Erik Martin, the General Manager of Reddit, from Denver, CO, to Danville, KY, to promote an open Internet during the Presidential and Vice Presidential debates. The Daily Dot put Alexis at the top of their list of the ten most influential activists of 2012 because of his work for an open internet. He was also called the “Mayor of the Internet” by Forbes Magazine. Ohanian started lobbying the FCC to support net neutrality in May 2014. On January 15, 2015, he held a phone-a-thon to call the FCC and Congress for a whole day. Ohanian used Tilt.com to start a crowdfunding campaign called “Save Net Neutrality: Billboard in FCC’s Backyard” to protest the FCC’s plans to eliminate net neutrality.</p><p>Ohanian also fights hard for paid paternity leave for everyone. He wrote about what happened when his daughter was born in the New York Times. His wife almost died while giving birth to their daughter and he was left to take care of his family. In June 2019, he said he would bring a promise of paid family leave to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In October 2015, there were rumors that Alexis was dating tennis star, Serena Williams. Serena and Alexis had been dating for over a year without telling anyone. On December 29, 2016, they announced that they were engaged. They got married in November 2017 and a few months earlier, in September 2017, they had a daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Serena-Williamss-Personal-Life-1.jpg><h2>Alexis Ohanian’s Net Worth: How Much Money Does The Reddit Co-founder Have?</h2><p>Alexis Ohanian is an American tech entrepreneur with a $40 million net worth.
