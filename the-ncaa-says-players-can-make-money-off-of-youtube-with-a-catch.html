De La Haye faced a decision: continue playing football, or continue making videos. He chose the latter, forgoing his full scholarship.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The NCAA released a statement saying De La Haye and other athletes can make videos – and even receive money from them – as long as the videos are not based on "athletics reputation, prestige, and ability."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That, of course, provides an interesting distinction. De La Haye could have posted videos about, say, muscle cars, and the NCAA wouldn't have had a problem with it. But athletes live and breathe their sport. It's tough to imagine De La Haye being as passionate or knowledgeable about another subject.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The kicker shared something he loved with his fans. In the NCAA's eyes, that doesn't fly. De La Haye claims he was originally told that even if he turned off the monetization feature, he couldn't post videos. The NCAA denied those allegations, though now they've clarified that videos were okay – just as long as they weren't about football.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The full statement from the NCAA is below:</span></p><p lang=ca dir=ltr>NCAA statement regarding Donald De La Haye. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0W2YCbEBrF</a></p><p>— NCAA News (@NCAA_PR) <a href=#>July 31, 2017</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>De La Haye isn't sure if he'll return to school in the fall, but may come back for the spring semester. He'd like to try his hand as a videographer for at least a few months, with plans to post videos daily.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One bright spot of this soap opera with the NCAA ? De La Haye has seen his subscribers and views skyrocket.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"It's lovely. It definitely is a blessing," he said in a recent interview.
