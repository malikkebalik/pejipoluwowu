At the start of this season, he began making his way back over the border for revenge, after faking his death. But after talking to his uncle, Hector Salamanca, he realized he needed to have proof in order to make such a move on Gus and left to find it.</p><p id=par-3_58>Viewers got to see what he’d been up to in Better Call Saul <a href=#>Season 6 Episode 5</a>. Lalo was revealed to be in Germany, using the name Ben, to further investigate the construction of Gus’ lab. He tracked down Werner Ziegler’s widow Margarethe and broke into her home while she was away, noticing a measuring&nbsp;ruler encased in glass.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The meaning of the ruler in ‘Better Call Saul’</h2><p id=par-4_51>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a> notes, the case is inscribed with the German words, “In Liebe… Deine Jungs,” which translates in English to “With Love… Your Boys.” This is a lead to figuring out the other men who worked with Werner, who could potentially tell Lalo about what they built for Gus.</p><p id=par-5_32>That information is all he needs to prove that Gus is secretly working against the cartel. But first, he’ll have to start with the item manufacturer in order to find Werner’s crew.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-predicted-what-could-happen-in-the-next-episode>Fans predicted what could happen in the next episode</h2><p id=par-6_21>In the meantime, fans have shared predictions on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> for what could happen in Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 6.</p><p id=par-7_27>“Lalo’s fate seems pretty much sealed after yesterday – he’s going to eventually find out where the lab is and have a confrontation with Mike/Gus,” one predicted.</p><p id=par-8_82>“He’ll figure out, from interviewing some of the remaining guys who worked on Gus’ tunnel, what is really going on,” said another. “Gus kills him in the tunnel with his gun in the end. Somehow Jimmy needs to be made aware that Lalo is still alive as well so perhaps Lalo will pay him a visit. And the guy with the axe, maybe Lalo convinced the German Mike punched in the face to get some revenge and join him in the tunnel.”</p><p id=par-9_46>Another agreed that Gus is “practicing” what to do in the event Lalo shows up, writing, “if you notice he started counting his strides after holding the switch that will turn off the lights. He is getting ready for the time he will bring Lalo here.”</p><p id=par-10_5>But others had different thoughts.</p><p id=par-11_53>“I don’t think Gus kills Lalo. I think he keeps him walled up in the basement, alive, to torture him, like in the story he told about the coati. Gus is going to Cask of Amontillado his a** in the end,” read one comment, referring to a short story by Edgar Allen Poe.</p><p id=par-12_22>Whatever happens, as one user put it, it “looks like Lalo will steal show again [like] he did with [the] recent episode.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvpsDTnqlmm5GhuW6%2FwK6jZquVlsCwuoxvZKutnJq%2FbrHXqaOaoZ6asW%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
