Their cover of the 1959 Jerry Keller song "Here Comes Summer" reached #49 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. Scott made his return to radio at WPGC-FM in Washington, D.C., and while he was program director, the station moved to #1 in the Arbitron ratings. He then moved to Atlanta's WQXI, followed by Tampa's WRBQ-FM (Q105), where he developed the "morning zoo" concept with partner Cleveland Wheeler.

That year he also started "Pirate Radio" station KQLZ in Los Angeles, which had a "Rock 40" format that focused on heavy metal and hard rock.

Shannon got involved with the hospital after reading about a child who suffered a brain injury and went into a coma after falling off his bike.
