This is important information to contemplate at the start of a new year, as it could determine whether you binge the whole show in one sitting or pace yourself and spread the episodes out over a few days.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-episodes-are-there-in-fool-me-once data-injectable=false>How many episodes are there in Fool Me Once?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once.png><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Fool Me Once is a relatively short series at only eight episodes in length. This is the standard length for most Harlan Coben TV shows, so if you’ve seen any of them before, you can expect a similar length here. At the moment there is only one season, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and it’s not likely there will be more</a>, so if you’re really enjoying the show, be sure to savor it.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Fool Me Once centers around former soldier Maya Stern, whose life is turned upside down when her husband is murdered shortly after her sister. As she grapples with her grief, things take an unexpected turn when Maya notices something on her new nanny cam that throws everything she thinks she knows into question. Is Maya hallucinating, or is someone playing the worst kind of trick on her? We only have so many episodes to find out.</p><h2 id=h-how-long-is-each-episode-of-fool-me-once data-injectable=false>How long is each episode of Fool Me Once?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fool-me-once-netflix.jpg><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Most episodes of Fool Me Once sit somewhere between 40 and 50 minutes, which is pretty standard for a Netflix show. The first episode is one of the longest, at 55 minutes, whilst the final episode for some reason is incredibly short at only 35 minutes.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>All in all, you can likely watch the whole series in one afternoon, as it adds up to about 6 hours and 20 minutes of content. But if that’s not enough for you, good news ahoy! There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty more Harlan Coben adaptations on Netflix</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tons of other great thrillers, too</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpJqmqWKysbXSqJueq12Wv6Z5yKdkp52km7mqxNJmnainnGK6pnnOp5qeZZGjsW60zrBkpaeenHqivsRmq6GdqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
