The mansion is reportedly 5,601 square feet and features a pool, four bedrooms, and four and a half baths. Because the home is so large, <a href=#>the “All Too Well” singer</a> was really able to go all out with her decorations. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Swift described her interior style as “Tim Burton-Alice in Wonderland-pirate ship-Peter Pan.”</p><h2>The ‘Blank Space’ singer has a koi pond in her home</h2><p id=par-3_79>Swift’s mystical vision is brought to life by her decorations. The house boasts a 6-foot topiary rabbit and a number of bird cages, the largest of which can fit an actual human. However, the most unique feature in the house seems to be the koi pond, which boasts real fish that Swift’s cat, Meredith, is afraid of. In a prior interview with Rolling Stone via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV</a>, Swift described the vision for her home before she actually executed it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_84>“It’s going to be my fantasy world,” Swift&nbsp;shared about decorating her house. “The ceiling of my living room is painted like the night sky. There’s a pond in the living room. The pond is a moat around the fireplace [that] may possibly have koi fish in it. You step on a stepping stone in the pond in order to get on a spiral staircase, which takes you to the human-size birdcage observatory. They’re delivering a human-size birdcage, which I’ll put a brass telescope in.”</p><h2>Swift initially wanted stingrays in her house</h2><p id=par-5_92>Swift eventually would fill her koi pond with real koi. However, initially, she envisioned a different type of fish in her living room. While speaking with MTV, Swift shared that she actually wanted to fill the pond with stingrays. So what was it that changed <a href=#>the Amsterdam actor’s</a> mind? It seems as if Swift was concerned about the smell they’d cause if she had more than a few. “If there are only two of them, it wouldn’t be much of an issue!” Swift revealed. “You get a Glade plug-in, and you’re fine!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-swift-might-have-been-an-interior-decorator-if-she-wasn-t-a-singer-songwriter>Swift might have been an interior decorator if she wasn’t a singer-songwriter</h2><p id=par-6_68>Clearly, Swift seems to have a very imaginative and unique way of furnishing her home. In fact, it seems to be a passion for the “I Bet You Think About Me” singer. While speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM</a>, Swift shared that she often furnishes her friends’ homes. In fact, the Pennslyvania native shared that she’d consider a career in interior decorating had she not found success as a musician.</p><p id=par-7_57>“I might have ended up following my passion for shopping for furniture and been an interior decorator,” Swift revealed. “I’ve been known to, like, go into my friends’ apartments and fill it with furniture. And they get home and it’s like furnished. My friends, they don’t like — they don’t buy furniture, and I love buying furniture.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBosXLqKlmq6ees7V5x6isrJ1doLyqec%2BopZ1lopqurbjYZq6apqSasW6%2F06KloKqRrsBvtNOmo2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
