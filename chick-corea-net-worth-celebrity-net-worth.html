Chick Corea created a number of modern jazz standards, including "Spain," "Windows," and "500 Miles High." He was a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 60s, and in the 70s founded the influential jazz groups Circle and Return to Forever. During his life Chick Corea won 27 Grammy Awards. That tied him with <a href=#>Alison Krauss</a> for having the fourth most wins in Grammy history, behind only <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, <a href=#>Quincy Jones</a> and <a href=#>Georg Solti</a>. Chick Corea died on February 9, 2021 from cancer.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Chick Corea, whose real name was Armando Corea, was born on June 12, 1941 in Chelsea, Massachusetts to Armando Sr. and Anna. He was of Italian descent. Corea was introduced to jazz at an early age thanks to his father, who led a Dixieland band in Boston. When he was four, he began playing the piano, and at the age of eight took up the drums. To develop his skills, Corea took lessons from concert pianist Salvatore Sullo; he also spent a number of years as a performer in the drum and bugle corps St. Rose Scarlet Lancers. He played gigs as a teenager, including as part of a trio at a local jazz club. Corea went on to move to New York City, where he attended Columbia University before transferring to the Juilliard School. However, dissatisfied, he dropped out.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Corea launched his professional career in the early 60s, recording and touring with such jazz artists as Willie Bobo, Herbie Mann, Stan Getz, and Blue Mitchell. Later in the decade, he released his debut solo album, "Tones for Joan's Bones." That was followed in short order by Corea's acclaimed second album, "Now He Sings, Now He Sobs," featuring acoustic bassist Miroslav VitouÅ¡ and drummer <a href=# title="Roy Haynes Net Worth">Roy Haynes</a>.</p><h2 id=partnership-with-miles-davis><strong>Partnership with Miles Davis</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Starting in the late 60s, Corea became renowned for his professional partnership with jazz musician <a href=#>Miles Davis</a>. In addition to touring with him, he appeared on several of Davis's most lauded studio albums, including "Filles de Kilimanjaro," "In a Silent Way," "Bitches Brew," and "On the Corner." Corea also made appearances on such live albums as "Black Beauty: Miles Davis at the Fillmore West" and "Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East." He remained a member of Davis's band until 1970.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170762 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chick-Corea1.jpg alt="Chick Corea" width=443 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-170762 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M.

Return to Forever's eponymous debut album came out in 1972 on ECM Records. The group's second studio album was 1973's "Light as a Feather," which launched one of Corea's most popular songs, "Spain."

In the late 90s, he ventured into contemporary classical music and composed his first piano concerto, which he performed with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Corea still continued to record jazz fusion albums into the 21st century. He created a new group, the Five Peace Band, with which he began a world tour in late 2008.</p><h2 id=scientology><strong>Scientology</strong></h2><p>Having read <a href=#>L. Ron Hubbard's</a> "Dianetics" in 1968, Corea developed an interest in Scientology that grew throughout the early 70s.
