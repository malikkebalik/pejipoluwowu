Yes, But Here Are Other Dating Apps To Try With Friends</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-01</div><p>If you're an avid Tinder user, you might have noticed that something about the app feels a little off lately... and unfortunately, it's bad news: Tinder Social, the feature that allowed users to organize group dates, has disappeared! That's right — no more swiping through groups of strangers with your friends on a night out, and no more weird but hilarious group chats with said strangers. So <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>what happened to Tinder Social</a>? Although it was a mildly successful feature, a Tinder spokesperson tells Bustle that Tinder Social has been "discontinued" because it didn't "fit cleanly with [their] future direction."</p><p>Here's the full statement from Tinder:</p><p><i>We discontinued Tinder Social in its initial format. While the feature gained modest adoption with no real marketing effort, it became apparent that the feature as devised didn’t fit cleanly with our future direction, which will be focused heavily on video, location and AI-driven features. We do believe, however, that these features will ultimately lead to a broader social experience on Tinder, which was the original intent of Tinder Social.</i></p><p>Even though <a href=# class=T3D>Tinder Social is no more</a>, it's clear that the folks at Tinder have plenty of awesome plans for features that will make <a href=# class=T3D>users' experience on the app</a> better than ever. But that doesn't mean that people aren't still interested in <a href=# class=T3D>using apps to meet people</a>, both friends and potential partners. Here are five other <a href=# class=T3D>social and group dating apps </a>you can try with your friends while you all pour one out for Tinder Social — may it rest in peace.</p><p><i>Check out Bustle's 'Save The Date' and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.</i></p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Apple App Store</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>CLIQ</a> is a "social discovery app" that allows you to swipe through nearby people and invite whoever you want into your group — where you can all get to know each other in a chat that will disappear the next day. Another cool feature? CLIQ will suggest a place to meet or an activity to do based on your location, so you and all your new friends can go hang out IRL.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Apple App Store</p></figure><p>If you're into getting free drinks (and who isn't?), <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cheers</a> is the perfect social app to check out. You can create a group with one or two friends, check out other groups of guys and girls going out that night, then meet up with whoever you hit if off with. All you have to do is pick a place to meet (there's a button for it right in the chat window) and then show up for your reservation — where your first round of drinks will be free.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Apple App Store</p></figure><p>Because <a href=# class=T3D>Bumble is all about empowering women</a>, they wanted to make the app about finding platonic friends, not just potential romantic connections. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bumble BFF</a> is a great way for ladies to make new friends and "find their beehive" — because let's be real, sometimes adulthood can be pretty lonely. Ugh, there's nothing I love more than a healthy dose of girl power.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Apple App Store</p></figure><p>Honestly, I saved the best for last: if you want to meet cool people and dogs (!!), then <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Meet My Dog</a> is the app for you. It's a "fresh breed" (get it?) of social app that allows you to connect with fellow dog owners in your area. You can set up play-dates at local dog parks and go hang out with a new person and their pooch. The best part? Even if you don't really connect as friends with the owner, at least you got to meet one more dog during your time on Earth.</p><p>Although Tinder Social is gone, there are still plenty of <a href=# class=T3D>apps that help you make new friends </a>out there — so don't be shy when it comes to platonic swiping. And hey, if <a href=# class=T3D>meeting people IRL</a> is more your speed, then do whatever works for you.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jqKqZqyZo7GmvoysppyhkaF6qLvNnmSynaNir7bAjKGcq51dlr%2Bmec6tn56qXZmutbXNoGSaqKCoerW7jK2psmWnnsGpecWroJ6mlKh6eISUbXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
