After becoming an orphan at an early age Tom realized he was different from the other children, and used his unusual gifts to hurt others. Just how different he was, was made apparent when he was visited by Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and he’d be attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=966 data-injectable=true>The young Tom is described as an attractive young man, tall and pale, with jet black hair and dark eyes who could easily charm people with his good looks and intelligence. Only Dumbledore was truly suspicious of Tom Riddle during those years as he played the model student and became House Prefect for Slytherin. We see this from the point-of-view of Tom himself in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Harry enters his diary and witnesses the events of the past, where he’s played by the handsome British actor, Christian Coulson, then aged 24-years-old.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Now, a full 20 years later, fans have found themselves equally ensnared by Tom’s good looks and are gushing over him on Reddit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><a href=#>What was your reaction to seeing Tom Riddle for the first time?

Through the enacting of his violent and murderous ways, Tom’s true face appears as he transitions to Lord Voldemort, letting the world really know what lies within. It is such a shame though, what a waste of a cutie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qa3Rq7BmqJ%2Bpwaa%2BjJ%2BYp6tdlr%2BmecauqqGhnpx6sMLEq2Stp51iv6qww6WcZqafqXq3u8udnKanoql8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
