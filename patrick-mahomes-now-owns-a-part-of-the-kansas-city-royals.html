The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback won a Super Bowl in February. Then, in July, he signed a record-setting $450 million contract extension, which could be worth up to $503 million.

It hasn't been reported how much of an investment Mahomes made. However, the franchise was purchased for $1 billion last year, so Mahomes likely had to pay a considerable amount to get involved."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the franchise was purchased for $1 billion last year, so Mahomes likely had to pay a considerable amount to get involved. Even a 1% ownership stake would cost him about $10 million. Up until this point in his career, Mahomes has only earned a total of $13 million on the field.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mahomes joins an ownership group led by businessman John Sherman and more than 20 investors with ties to Kansas City, including actor <a href=# title="Eric Stonestreet Net Worth">Eric Stonestreet</a>. Although Mahomes's role will be more ambassador than operational, it's still a nice addition to his resume.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ownership in the Royals isn't the only spending Mahomes has been doing, either. ESPN's Louis Riddick tweeted a picture of a ride the freshly paid quarterback just purchased.</span></p><p>https://twitter.com/LRiddickESPN/status/1288170131311525888</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That's a Ferrari 812 Superfast, the newest addition to Mahomes's collection. The ride starts at $338,000 and contains a V-12 engine with 788 horsepower.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Mahomes is the son of Pat Mahomes, a former major league pitcher. The elder Mahomes pitched in more than 300 baseball games, primarily as a reliever.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The younger Mahomes was also a baseball prospect in his younger days. The Detroit Tigers drafted him in 2014, though he never played for them.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>It's fair to say he made the right choice by playing football. But with this latest move, he'll still have an opportunity to make some noise on a baseball field.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-305075 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1203665119.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-305075 class=wp-caption-text>Andy Lyons/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqmYraqZmLhuucChpqado2K7sMOMqK6nq12WerGt0a1kqJ5dqbWmecqapayZo2KwqsDYZqmosZGhwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
