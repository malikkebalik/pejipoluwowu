Elvis denied he’d been unfaithful, which was not&nbsp;true.&nbsp;Not only had he pursued a relationship with Priscilla, but he was&nbsp;dating other people as well.&nbsp;One of them was Sandy Ferra, the teenage daughter of a Los Angeles club owner.</p><p id=par-3_33>Ferra said one of Elvis’ friends would pick her up, and she would spend time with Elvis at his house. While she typically enjoyed these visits, one of their dates was incredibly uncomfortable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Elvis-women.jpg><p id=par-4_85>“One time I wore pants, and Lamar [Fike] picked me up and didn’t say anything, we&nbsp;drove out to the house&nbsp;and&nbsp;I walked in, and Elvis was all dressed up, because he always got dressed up for our&nbsp;dates,” Ferra said in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley</a>&nbsp;by Peter Guralnick. “So he said, ‘Hi, baby,’ and he kissed me on the cheek, and we sat down on the couch, and he did not speak to me for the next three or four hours. It seemed like an eternity.”</p><p id=par-5_26>As Ferra would soon find out, Elvis did not like to see women in pants. He warned her against wearing them in front of him again.</p><p id=par-6_50>“Then he kissed me good night,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he&nbsp;said, ‘Don’t ever wear pants again,’” she recalled.&nbsp;“I said, ‘Oooooh, I won’t.’ Cause he said he got all dressed up for me, and he expected me to get dressed up, too. So I always wore my prettiest party dresses from then on. No more pants.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elvis-had-the-same-reaction-to-another-date-years-nbsp-later>Elvis had the same reaction to another date years&nbsp;later</h2><p id=par-7_31>Years later, Elvis still didn’t like his dates to wear pants. After spending one night with Sheila Ryan, he took her shopping so that she could dress according to his tastes.</p><p id=par-8_60>“I mean, I wasn’t appropriate, I always dressed in men’s trousers, not terribly feminine,” Ryan said. “So he had Suzy Creamcheese [the&nbsp;place to go for Vegas fashion] bring over a couple of racks of clothes and shoes and had this fashion show.&nbsp;I would go in and try something on, and if&nbsp;he liked it, he’d get it, and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t, he wouldn’t.”</p><p id=par-9_16>Elvis told Ryan that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;with her, he wanted her to&nbsp;<a href=#>look a certain way</a>.</p><p id=par-10_58>“I was kind of like, ‘What’s the matter with my clothes?’ and he was very gentle in saying, ‘Nothing, they’re fine, but you’re my girl, you got to go into this place, and people will be looking, and I’d like you to look a certain way, is that okay?’&nbsp;And, you know, I guess it was okay, kind of.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-bought-new-wardrobes-for-nbsp-girlfriends>He bought new wardrobes for&nbsp;girlfriends</h2><p id=par-11_35>Over the years, Elvis spent a fortune dressing the various women&nbsp;in his life. He frequently took Priscilla Presley to stores and had her spend hours trying on clothing. He exercised rigid control over her appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Elvis-Priscilla-1.jpg><p id=par-12_20>“I was Elvis’ doll, his own living doll, to fashion as he pleased,” she wrote in her book&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elvis and Me</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_10>Priscilla&nbsp;<a href=#>styled her hair, makeup</a>, and clothing according to Elvis’ tastes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrcLIrGSin56kv6awjJ2YrZ1dnby2vtJmnZqrmJ68r3nCoaaim5VjtbW5y2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
