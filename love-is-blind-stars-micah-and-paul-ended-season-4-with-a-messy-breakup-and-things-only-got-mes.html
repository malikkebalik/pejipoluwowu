She earned a reputation for <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>being a mean girl</a> in the pods, and he's an <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>environmental scientist</a> with a nerdy edge.</p><p>But they made it down the aisle nonetheless — only to have Paul dump Micah at the altar in the finale. In the aftermath of his devastating decision, Paul explains to the cameras that he struggled to envision Micah as a mother because he didn't think she was "nurturing."</p><p>That sure seems like a pretty definitive breakup. But on the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>season four reunion</a>, which was filmed and aired on April 16, fans learn that the formerly engaged couple continued to date each other for a while after the "Love Is Blind" cameras initially stopped rolling, before splitting again. And the new <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>"After the Altar" episodes </a>that premiered Friday revealed that things between the exes got pretty messy after their aborted wedding — even after Paul got in a new relationship.</p><p>Here's everything we know about Micah and Paul's relationship today.</p><h2>'After the Altar' reveals Micah and Paul kept in touch after their split</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Micah and Paul on "Love Is Blind: After the Altar" season 4. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p>On "After the Altar," Micah reveals that she's still friends with Paul's mom, Liz, and the ladies meet up to spill tea when Micah moves back to Seattle. She admits to her almost-mother-in-law that she believes there are "lingering" feelings between her and Paul and says she still talks to him, but neither of them wants to admit their emotions.</p><p>Paul also admits to his mom in a separate scene that he still has feelings for Micah, though he is dating another woman at the time. He claims that Micah was actually the person who officially ended their relationship for good when the "Love Is Blind" cameras stopped rolling. He wasn't ready to give up on the relationship yet, but Micah had moved from Washington to Arizona at the time and thought the distance between them was too hard.</p><p>He tells his mom that Micah said she'd be open to dating him if they ever "lived in the same place." Paul moved on, but hadn't cut off their communication. Throughout <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>"After the Altar"</a> Micah tells her friends that she and Paul have leaned on each other at different times, but she began feeling strange about their relationship since he was dating someone else.</p><p>On the final "After the Altar" episode, Micah and Paul have a conversation where she tells him that it's "hard and confusing" to keep talking to him while he's in a relationship with someone else. She tells him that she still loves him, but she has to cut off communication with him to move on with her life.</p><p>It's not made clear exactly when the "After the Altar" episodes were filmed, but <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Decider</a> deduced that it was probably around May 2023 based on the inclusion of fellow contestant Chelsea Griffin's birthday celebration. Micah and Paul had some <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>slightly confusing Instagram interactions in April</a>, which led some to believe they may have been reuniting yet again.</p><p>But on May 30, Paul <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>went public on Instagram</a> with his apparent new girlfriend, a woman named Geneva Dunham. It's not clear whether Geneva was the woman Paul mentioned he was dating when he was still in contact with Micah on "After the Altar."</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>A post shared by Geneva Dunham (@genevadunham)</a></p><p>Geneva and Paul also <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>went on vacation together</a> in July, which is the last Instagram photo that appears on Paul's account. It's also not clear if Paul and Geneva are still together as of now, though there's no reason to believe they've broken up. So odds are, Micah and Paul are most likely done for good.</p><p>Season 4 of "Love Is Blind: After the Altar" is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=body-italic>Disclosure: Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
