Disney recently released a behind the scenes video, and it highlights the young star at her best. Take a look:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>“Rob would often encourage me to like, ad-lib,” she says in the clip, which then cuts to Scuttle asking for a compliment from Ariel (Halle Bailey). Scuttle to Ariel:</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>“You know, why don’t you tell me something nice. Hey Scuttle, I like your hair. I like the center part because the side part looks like it’s receding a little bit.”</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>Her behind the scenes Sebastian riff goes like this: “I love you, Sebastian, and I wanna get married to you. And I wanna do it in Vegas, and I want my family to be there as witnesses.”</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HelloGiggles</a> interview from 2020, Awkwafina said that getting to put her own spin on Scuttle was “really cool” and that she was genuinely shocked when she was offered the part. She said when she got the news she “couldn’t believe it” because Scuttle was “a favorite character of mine.”</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>“And then I met [director] Rob Marshall, who directed some of my favorite moves ever like&nbsp;Chicago, and I definitely was a little intimidated.” However, once she got to work with Rob Marshall and Lin Manuel Miranda on the music, things became much easier.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>She said they both “provided a really comfortable and nice environment to just do it.” In a more recent recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ScreenRant</a>, Awkwafina said she had zero desire to try and replicate Hackett’s take on the character. Instead, she wanted to make a character that was completely her own.</p><p>“Aw, man. Buddy Hackett’s performance in the original is so good and so memorable, and I think you can’t duplicate that performance. The Scuttle that we’ve grown up with is Scuttle, but what I definitely did want to incorporate was that Scuttle is a nosybody, she’s a meddler and she’s also very neurotic, so I feel like those came easy. It was so fun to play Scuttle.”</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>The Little Mermaid hits theaters on May 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TApMHTraOeq12hrqS3y66qrZ2iYrCotYywpqesXZeybrHNqKygoF2pvG6%2F06inZpmnoMSissinmGaeoqS6br%2FTnpiloZ6cerW0xGaqoaenYravedOhnGakmanBrbGMppyrpZGesXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
