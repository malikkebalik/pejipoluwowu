They both auditioned for the part, but Damon lucked out and got it solely because he’s two years older than Affleck.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-damon-and-ben-affleck-both-auditioned-for-a-1-line-role-in-mystic-pizza>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both auditioned for a 1-line role in ‘Mystic Pizza’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg><p id=par-4_14>Damon revealed the little-known information during a 2019 interview with The Off Camera Show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_28>“Mystic Pizza, one of the first things ever, my one line in Mystic Pizza, Ben and I were the only two people who auditioned for it,” Damon revealed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-only-reason-matt-damon-got-the-part-is-that-he-s-older-than-ben-affleck>The only reason Matt Damon got the part is that he’s older than Ben Affleck</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_23>Even though Damon and Affleck both had impressive auditions, Damon managed to land the part thanks to a legal loophole he benefited from.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_90>“We went in and did the reading, and it turned out we were both good, but I was 17 and he was 15. It was a night shoot, so it went to me because I could work through the night legally if my mom was there. So my mom came with me and it was three nights of shooting this dinner table scene in Mystic Pizza. … It was so great. I mean, now I’d be like, ‘Why the f*** is this taking three nights to shoot,’” Damon said, laughing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-rejection-is-a-part-of-the-movie-business>He says rejection is a part of the movie business&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_17>Damon noted that rejection is just part of the game when one aspires to be an actor.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_43>“It’s a business that just rejects you,” Damon said. “It just rejects you, constantly. … And you have to be impervious to that. Ben and I used to call it getting ‘Ok, thanks’ed.’ Like, ‘Hey, how’d it go today?’ ‘I got Ok, thanks’ed.’”</p><p id=par-10_24>Earlier in his career, the rejection was tougher for Damon to deal with because he was in a much less comfortable position in life.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_52>“‘Cause you’d go in and you’d act your heart out for some scene, for some thing, and they’d go, ‘Ok, thanks.’ And that’s it. And now you’re in two f****** hours of traffic in your s***** car ‘cause you live way out of town because that’s all you can afford,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-stillwater-star-always-had-confidence-in-his-work-ethic>The ‘Stillwater’ star always had confidence in his work ethic</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_44>Despite all of the setbacks Damon faced earlier in his career, he never allowed the rejection to get to him. He knew that even though other actors might’ve had more connections or talent than him, none of them would be able to outwork him.</p><p id=par-13_82>“I think my one skill is that I’ll outwork anybody,” Damon said in the same interview. “I’ll work harder, especially at that age, right? Where certainly starting out, Ben and I would go to auditions where kids would be there with their parents. Like, their mom was making them go, because their mom had some unrealized fantasy about doing it and was trying to live it through the kid. I’m gonna beat that guy, I want it way more than him, right?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6osDTZpuapZ%2Bjeq2tzZ2cnWWipLmmecyyqq2hk2K9qsbZmmSorpWneqOxzWaYn56cmrCsecGempqto5p6qbGMoqpmrKekerqxwKuqZqecmbKzesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
